00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
the science elan podcast I'm your host

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,589
Michael Shermer as you all know we do

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,649
this once a week on the Tuesdays that

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,809
books are released this week's book and

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,900
author is my longtime friend Christoph

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,420
Kok his new book is the feeling of life

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,279
itself

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,560
why consciousness is widespread but

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,140
can't be computed so you can see where

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,740
that's going

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,990
I've known Christoph since the early 90s

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,390
so probably almost a quarter century now

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,830
he's one of the most interesting people

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,859
have ever met super delightful guy very

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,860
smart very witty and has a real lust for

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,710
life and he's now left Caltech and has

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,050
been at the Allen Brain Institute for I

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,850
don't know must be at least a decade now

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,250
and so we talked a little bit about that

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,170
the research and work that they do there

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,550
what are they doing when they're trying

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,410
to find the neural correlates of

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,510
consciousness we get into the hard

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,829
problem of consciousness and what that

25
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,129
means the integrated information theory

26
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,780
of consciousness versus the global work

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,899
space theory of consciousness and we

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,570
talked about comas and and vegetative

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,390
States and you know is there anybody

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,970
there how do we know they need to find

31
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,060
these things the nature of the self and

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,950
identity if you have a split brain

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,110
there's really two Minds so if you have

34
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,659
two Minds is that two persons two selves

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,220
you know what does that all mean so we

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,330
explore some of that and and pretty much

37
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,979
cover most of the the major

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,080
philosophical issues related to the

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,840
mind-body problem how consciousness

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,150
arrives from a physical system why he

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,340
thinks that no computer will ever be

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,490
conscious the what they're designed to

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,890
do and the underlying architecture the

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,759
structure of it of computers that as

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,920
currently configured will never ever be

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,530
conscious and he makes pretty good

47
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,170
argument I think not that it can't be

48
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,460
done it's just that it's not going to be

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,680
done the way we're doing it now I think

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,780
he's probably right in the sense that

51
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,040
you know it's a much harder problem than

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
anybody ever realized when we're talking

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,200
about creating conscious computers back

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,240
in the 90s and still hasn't happened I

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,190
think it's just way more difficult than

56
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,340
anybody realized and anyway it's a great

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,590
book it's really you know short straight

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,450
to the point he's a clear rider clear

59
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,840
thinker and again he really it's in the

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,580
title itself what is consciousness is

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,340
the feeling of life itself or as he says

62
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,470
even more succinctly it's its experience

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,550
consciousness is experience so

64
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,230
consciousness has lived reality it is

65
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,540
the feeling of life itself it is the

66
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,519
only bit of eternity to which I am

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,010
entitled without experience I would be a

68
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,519
zombie a nothing to myself anyway great

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,860
book if you appreciate the podcast as

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,900
usual we appreciate your support either

71
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,090
through patreon every month or at

72
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,390
skeptic comm / donate thank you I give

73
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,640
you Christophe

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,660
Christophe is that Francis Crick

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,920
behind you there yes it's a painting he

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,780
gave me it's a it's a photocopy of him

77
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,209
in its wicked share a half he gave that

78
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,400
to me half a year before he passed away

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,299
and it says for christophe francis

80
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,500
keeping an eye on you so you you have

81
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,599
them there in your office watching over

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,239
you at all times okay looking over my

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,560
shoulder at all times

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,420
yes and that also looks like the other

85
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,590
is that the cover of The Beatles Sgt

86
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,430
pepper's conferences

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,049
oh I see very good right fine yeah to

88
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,980
include David Thomas myself and two

89
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,549
other you know couple yeah yeah no

90
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,230
that's really funny yeah very good so I

91
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,690
am speaking to you at the Allen Brain

92
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,060
Institute in Seattle Washington where

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,950
you were wooed away from Caltech

94
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,579
amazingly enough that's right so before

95
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,500
we dive into your book just again to

96
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,150
introduce everybody just remind you why

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,260
you're here your new book so you haven't

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,169
even seen your book no yeah the feeling

99
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,540
of life itself why consciousness is

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,819
widespread but can't be computed okay

101
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,070
well yeah some people are gonna dispute

102
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,419
that but that's it before we get into

103
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,039
that though just kind of catch us up you

104
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,329
know you're famous for having worked

105
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,650
with Francis Crick when you were at

106
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,599
Caltech and you were had kind of the

107
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,250
traditional academic career just

108
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,710
grinding

109
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,060
doing your thing and then all of a

110
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,490
sudden you're now in Seattle running the

111
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,190
Allen Brain Institute what what is it

112
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,750
you're doing there and why did you do

113
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,520
that transition so we have three no 30

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,780
scientists focus on a few very large

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,539
projects in the brain sciences so for

116
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,130
instance we have a big nature paper

117
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,440
coming out next week where we look at

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,250
human brain material so either from

119
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,930
their brain or from neurosurgical

120
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,020
excised brain tissue and 20 minutes

121
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,060
later after the neurosurgeon takes it

122
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,039
out of the brain of a patient it sits in

123
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,039
our in our lab and then we can do what's

124
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,710
called single-cell transcriptomics so we

125
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,360
can read out all the genes that are

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,789
expressed in the different new ones to

127
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,830
get a view of how many types of

128
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,289
different brain cells they are in a in a

129
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,599
human compared to the different types of

130
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,180
brain cells in a mouse now many are

131
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,550
there in humans versus a mouse's well in

132
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,500
any one cortical area turns out it's

133
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,199
roughly the same roughly 100 and that's

134
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,360
the same number in human and mouse and

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,090
it's sort of similar the number of genes

136
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,070
when people first in the late 80s

137
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,070
identified 20,000 genes in the mouse

138
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,349
genome they said Wow humans are clearly

139
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,180
vastly more complex so they're going to

140
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,740
have hundred thousand or two nuts off no

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,630
they're roughly the same number of genes

142
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,110
we have roughly the same number of types

143
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,580
of different neurons probably across

144
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,889
entire brain on the order of a thousand

145
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,320
two thousand five thousand although

146
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,060
there are many many differences in those

147
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,060
difference matter so particularly if you

148
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,610
here for example if you are into making

149
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,250
drugs to help people with schizophrenia

150
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,580
or autism and you for example you're

151
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,340
after serotonin receptors and you make a

152
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,070
drug based on some animal that um in a

153
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,320
particular Mouse experiment well the

154
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,080
same the same serotonin receptor may be

155
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,570
distributed looks.i looks like it's it's

156
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,789
on different types of cells so therefore

157
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:22,990
what you found

158
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,639
you're fine in the mouse doesn't really

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,740
generalize to what you find in in human

160
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,020
so while the principles are similar the

161
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,820
details really differ greatly which

162
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,340
explains why some so much drug research

163
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,770
there was you know started in the mouse

164
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,070
you can cure mice but you can cure human

165
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,999
with that

166
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,039
and is that because just the

167
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,499
combinatorial complexity of you know

168
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,239
when you just start grinding along on

169
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,239
the the numbers of combinations and they

170
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,769
just don't extrapolate from one species

171
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,159
to the other yeah you got to remember if

172
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,049
you trace us back and down the

173
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,489
evolutionary tree the last common

174
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,229
answers to lived you know at the time of

175
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,419
the eye of the dinosaurs 65 million

176
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,669
years ago and so since then we we've

177
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,039
diverged your brains are build along

178
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,169
similar principle but all the details

179
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,509
have changed over the last 65 million

180
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:10,959
years

181
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,849
so you really gotta work with human

182
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,319
brain tissue which of course it's much

183
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,839
more challenging what year did Francis

184
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:23,019
died in 2004 2004 so it's 15 years what

185
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,939
what have we discovered since then that

186
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,860
he would be surprised about or pleased

187
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,849
to see solved or or still mystified in

188
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,839
the or whatever well so first of all I

189
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,059
was recently rereading there's a very

190
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,099
one of his better known articles was

191
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,899
written in 1979 well in 1979 so that's

192
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,619
basically you know that's that's 40

193
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,149
years ago when he just made the

194
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,219
transition from molecular biology to

195
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,110
neurobiology and when he also made the

196
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,509
transition from Cambridge England to La

197
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,300
Jolla here in California and he wrote a

198
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,449
very forward-looking article about about

199
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,159
brain sciences and some of the things it

200
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,589
should be invented and so their focus on

201
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,899
ba-leep he predicted well wouldn't it be

202
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,610
great if we have tools that light up

203
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,339
neurons with you know with flashes of

204
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,229
light when they when they have when they

205
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,479
discharge electrical activity wouldn't

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,249
be cool if we can turn you on

207
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,679
selectively on and off hmm these are all

208
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,449
tools that people developed over the Oh

209
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,999
over the last decade

210
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,799
so those things he would have been

211
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,199
comfortable with what he probably would

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
continue to be surprised at it's a vast

213
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,539
complexity of the brain you know even

214
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,669
you know when were when he and I worked

215
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,769
together 15 or 20 years ago we thought

216
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,539
there were going to be simpler molecular

217
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,769
codes that Express which cells are you

218
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,970
know sort of living in which bits which

219
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,649
specific part of the brain and all of

220
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,300
that turned out to be much much more

221
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,760
complicated than we were

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,430
we had imagined and some of the the

223
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,010
possibility to manipulate the human

224
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,890
brain again he might have been surprised

225
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,630
on the other end he was very fast

226
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,160
thinking so I'm not sure whether they

227
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,930
really would have been surprised by many

228
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,320
of the current developments I was trying

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,150
to find that famous quote for his book

230
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,220
the astonishing hypothesis what is it

231
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,050
you your joys and your sorrows your

232
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,580
memories and your ambitions your sense

233
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,190
of personal identity and free will and

234
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,340
let me see what's the rest of that quote

235
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,410
I mean it's still kind of true yeah are

236
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,870
in fact are in fact no more than the

237
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,640
behavior of a vast assembly of nerve

238
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
cells and their associated molecules of

239
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,270
course that's so broad it's kind of true

240
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,730
by definition but but why was that

241
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,690
astonishing at the at the time it wasn't

242
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,240
I mean it was a book titled that he

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,460
later regretted it was suggested to him

244
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,290
by his publisher never that would be

245
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,330
catchy no this is what most brain

246
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,400
scientists believed at the time and

247
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,210
believed to do

248
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,640
Tooley that ultimately who you are is a

249
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,430
part of your neurons also and this is

250
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,890
important it's not the same as us your

251
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,410
nuance right so my experience my love

252
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,390
that I have for my wife or for my

253
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,000
children it's not the same as the

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
neurons that that are involved in that

255
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,350
action those are really two different

256
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,740
things

257
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,560
one is necessary for the other right

258
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,180
it's sort of the physical substrate of

259
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,160
the other it's not my heart as ancient

260
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,690
believe it's not my liver that give rise

261
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,870
to my feelings it is the brain but but

262
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,850
the brain is different from the feelings

263
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,340
that that the brain gives rise to yeah

264
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,020
so there you're identifying the hard

265
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,880
problem of consciousness what it what it

266
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,730
feels like to be something or to

267
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,890
experience something yeah I mean yes

268
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,750
you're right so the hard poem is trying

269
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,430
to understand how one relates to the

270
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,890
other in a scientific empirical and

271
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,690
useful manner and of course some

272
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,100
philosophers claim this can never be

273
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
done me I don't know you know

274
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,970
philosophers have claimed many things

275
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,770
thought they hated said can't be done so

276
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,690
one has to be a little bit skeptical it

277
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,490
is indeed challenging it is difficult

278
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,450
there's no question about it yes so well

279
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,640
but the question is is it a conceptual

280
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,500
problem that is a problem with our

281
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
concepts or is it a scientific problem

282
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,080
that is is there any experiment you can

283
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,140
run and say there that explains exactly

284
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,460
why I experienced something well so it's

285
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,030
a we need an entire theory there's no

286
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,890
single experiment that will ever

287
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,050
convince anybody but it's the same in

288
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,000
physics if you look at quantum mechanics

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,770
you know as you well know Michael

290
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,450
quantum mechanics make some very weird

291
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,640
predictions right and so cook but

292
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,740
collectively we believe scientists

293
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,390
believe quantum mechanics is the best

294
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,640
description we have of the universe at

295
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,980
the micro scale and so ultimately we

296
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,900
need a theory of consciousness that

297
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,790
explains your consciousness and how it

298
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,590
arises in your brain and what happens

299
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,120
when you might get a stroke and what

300
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,650
happens in babies what happens in

301
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,660
animals what happens when you go to

302
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,220
sleep what happens when you have you

303
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,560
know various mental diseases and then we

304
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
have to see what are some of the

305
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,000
implications of such a theory for

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,710
instance for computers or for other

307
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,380
systems that we might not currently

308
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,860
think of as as being conscious well so

309
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,440
the title of your book the feeling of

310
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,450
life itself that is your definition of

311
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,660
consciousness ultimately yeah it's a

312
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,450
quite common one ultimately

313
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,690
consciousness is any experience any

314
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,580
feeling you have yeah you say

315
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,810
consciousness is experience yes yes as

316
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,170
in equals yes that's what yes

317
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,840
it's any experience that you have the

318
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
this subjective aspect it feels like

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
something you know to be angry to be

320
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,390
upset to know that you're gonna die one

321
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,000
day to be happy to be in love you know

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,250
to have a toothache to look at you to

323
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,660
hear me those are all different

324
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,490
experiences that's what consciousness is

325
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,420
yeah so but let's say you and I are both

326
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,480
looking at a red dot or whatever and in

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,510
back in our visual cortex at the same

328
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,220
spot is lighting up in an fMRI we would

329
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,650
say that's the neural correlates of that

330
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,630
conscious experience of seeing something

331
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,540
red but that's but where's the red our

332
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,370
mutual friend Deepak Chopra would say

333
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,630
where's the red well in this case the

334
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,480
experience is a consequence of the or

335
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
it's not a consequence no is it's really

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,360
the

337
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,670
you have a physical substrate let's see

338
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,319
some neurons being you know

339
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,179
interconnected in a particular way and

340
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,480
they are associated with this feeling

341
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,540
it's not that that first set is a

342
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,189
physical action and then there is a

343
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,259
feeling because that sort of dualism and

344
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,149
in scientists you know sort of tend to

345
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,009
reject that no you have the physical

346
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,959
constituency you have your brain or part

347
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,049
of it and then that sort of is

348
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,299
coextensive with a particular experience

349
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,649
whatever the expense will be seeing

350
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,040
rather being angry right it seems to me

351
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,989
this is this gets us to an answer to the

352
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,730
question of you know the problem of

353
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,009
other minds or how do I know you're

354
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,660
you're you're not a zombie and I'm the

355
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,639
only human that's actually sentient

356
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,879
because your brain is wired the same as

357
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,369
mine or very similar that the Copernican

358
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,309
principle says I'm not special so the

359
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,199
chances that you know you're completely

360
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,089
different on an experiential level than

361
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,589
I am even though we have the same wire

362
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,110
and is very low therefore the inference

363
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,670
to the best explanation is we're all

364
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,100
sentient perfect that's exactly I would

365
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,829
like I couldn't have better I could have

366
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,269
put it better myself now I don't really

367
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,799
know that but it's an inference as you

368
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,059
said it's an influence of the best

369
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,199
explanation yes right so well so that

370
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,790
gets to yeah well anyway just sort of

371
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,619
we're getting slightly ahead of

372
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,540
ourselves but you you know you you right

373
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,699
here consciousness has lived reality it

374
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,529
is the feeling of life itself is the

375
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,329
only bit of eternity to which I am

376
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,910
entitled without experience I would be a

377
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,399
zombie ain't nothing to myself so

378
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,110
there's there is all the neural activity

379
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,720
then there's this other layer of I don't

380
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,129
know what you want to call it I've sort

381
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,179
of a metaphysical layer or no it's not

382
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,790
yeah yeah that's my reality remember the

383
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,529
only thing I know off I said I have

384
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,119
feelings even anything else right but by

385
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,040
this definition that I would assume my

386
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,869
dog you have a dog I have a chocolate

387
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:17,279
lab I assume he's he experiences things

388
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,709
he there he has experiences similar to

389
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,100
mine therefore he is conscious yes

390
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,689
there's no question about it I don't

391
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,790
know by the way a single dog owner or

392
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,069
cat owner that would deny that that

393
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:30,720
their companion animals also have

394
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,819
feelings now they're not as complex as

395
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:33,749
yours or mine

396
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,350
my

397
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,600
my dog doesn't know he's gonna die one

398
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,270
day my dogs don't have that capacity I'm

399
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,490
not sure how much my dog you know thinks

400
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,560
about himself you know I like you think

401
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,360
about myself and I project myself in the

402
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,490
future I think about the past my dog

403
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,320
lives you know it's much more like a bit

404
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,630
like a Buddhist he lives in Bahia now

405
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,000
yeah he's very mindful in that in that

406
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,760
way most of us are not but yes he has

407
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,350
conscious experience no question about

408
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,800
it

409
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,830
your dog is enlightened in some sense

410
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,540
yes he's more enlightened because I'm

411
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,280
always obsessed about the future all

412
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,930
about the past most people are right

413
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,480
right because me think what would happen

414
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,460
then you replay the last dialogue the

415
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,960
last fight you had with your girlfriend

416
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,330
or whatever my dog doesn't do that my

417
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,930
dog is much more in the present yeah

418
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,240
yeah but so by this definition then it's

419
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,820
really just a scalable spectrum of like

420
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,620
instead of the lights coming on and off

421
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,510
like a switch of consciousness it's more

422
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,130
like a rheostat that you know you just

423
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,260
kind of turn it up it's very dim or it's

424
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,760
a little brighter and brighter and

425
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,090
brighter based on what the number of not

426
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,590
just a number of neurons but how they're

427
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,600
wired and in the complexity of the

428
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,670
neural networks and so on again you

429
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,290
you're putting it very well now that's

430
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,880
probably to pose at the level of

431
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,920
individual over your lifetime as well as

432
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,260
the cost species in other words when you

433
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,580
think back when were your first

434
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,740
conscious when when did you actually

435
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,530
first have an experience was it you know

436
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,390
when your your mom and your dad got

437
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,010
together and they you know the sperm

438
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,199
fertilized the egg was it at the stage

439
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,020
of blastocyte when you were 16 cells was

440
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,150
it at the end of your first term when

441
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,699
you had a brain you know after ten weeks

442
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,339
you have already a brain right and then

443
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,829
that goes is it when you when you exit

444
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,620
from your mom's womb into the world when

445
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,480
you finally have to breathe oxygen and

446
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,160
you scream and there's light and sound

447
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,490
and all of that or the or does it occur

448
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,260
June you know in the first two three

449
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,820
years of life when you get when you

450
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,250
would when you start speaking and even

451
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,600
as a teenager there's certain things

452
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,460
that you still have no experiences of

453
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,170
like like like the experience of being

454
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,930
in love or sex or wine of drugs all of

455
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,990
those right so you expand your conscious

456
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,760
experiences and then of course at the

457
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,500
end of life you know maybe there's

458
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,250
dementia

459
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,200
maybe you know you'll have a stroke or

460
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,420
something you know so so it waxes and

461
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,400
Wayne as it does during the day right

462
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,380
when you go to sleep your consciousness

463
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,750
is off and the same thing as you said

464
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,660
will change across different species

465
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,100
somehow scaling with the complexity of

466
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,110
their brain do you distinguish between

467
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,270
consciousness and sentience no I don't

468
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,650
awareness consciousness subjectivity

469
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,390
those are just different names but it's

470
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,490
all the basic same phenomena it feels

471
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,770
like something right you experience

472
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,280
pleasures pains suffering whatever yes

473
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,500
yeah that's why I always like Jeremy

474
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,440
Bentham's famous quote about it sort of

475
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,150
the grounding of animal rights not can

476
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,680
they thinking can they talk but can they

477
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,770
suffer yes yes ultimately I think that's

478
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,580
that's that's a key inside the suffering

479
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,460
the ability to suffer or not I mean

480
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,900
we're way ahead on this is you at the

481
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,210
end of your book on animal rights but

482
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,980
that's kind of where it begins and if

483
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,400
you really believe that then I don't

484
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,710
know how in the animal sentient beings

485
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,270
we kill every year it's like a trillion

486
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,830
a year if you count every chicken and

487
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,890
fish and so on I mean this is like worse

488
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,340
than the Holocaust every year so I

489
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,760
thought recently a quote in a restaurant

490
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,970
Germany and they said for for animals

491
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,810
its Treblinka every day

492
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,490
yeah and so I mean one reason I'm the

493
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,800
main reason I'm a vegetarian since many

494
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,380
many years because I don't want to do

495
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,930
that anymore you know certainly advanced

496
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,270
so I had this I had this epiphany the

497
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,460
night my beloved German Shepherd I was

498
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,050
fifteen years ago the black German

499
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,790
Shepherd know that she died in my arms I

500
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,770
was distraught and was crying and then I

501
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,020
thought well at the same time I loved

502
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,660
the the flesh of pigs and lambs and

503
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,070
their brain is roughly the same

504
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,140
complexity is that of my dog right so

505
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,780
they so I that night I promised my I

506
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,390
promised my nosey in her honor I would

507
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,130
never eat the flesh of another conscious

508
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,410
creature again and you did it and I

509
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,460
haven't what was her name nosy nosy nosy

510
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,770
she was intensely curious knows my black

511
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,440
gem shall I see nosy yes okay got it

512
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,330
black German Shepherd yeah German

513
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,190
Shepherds are they're really great dog

514
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,330
I've had two of those yeah well I mean

515
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,440
this is one of those things you think

516
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,480
like I wrote that book the moral arc and

517
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,370
people then ask well you know what's the

518
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,050
next stage well it's got to be animal

519
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,330
rights you know and it's one of these

520
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,650
things like if we were chronically

521
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,390
frozen and came back five hundred years

522
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,670
from now how would people then look back

523
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,120
at 20th century 21st century what what

524
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,190
we think about now you know they would

525
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,870
probably accuse us of being you know

526
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,350
like the equivalent of slave owners or

527
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,260
genocide 'el you know maniacs I think

528
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,790
there was an excellent point I mean we

529
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,710
today of course we believe we're morally

530
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,990
superior to every other previous culture

531
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,240
because you know we we have less races

532
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,940
and we have less misogyny but you know

533
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,830
but you're right they're horrible other

534
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,360
things that people simply don't think

535
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,620
about it when you talk to them about

536
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,410
about suffering some people would say

537
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,000
yeah you probably arrived but it tastes

538
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,360
too good

539
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
most people don't even think about it at

540
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,690
all

541
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,300
yeah just like presumably it it you know

542
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,130
when the Greeks were around nobody

543
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,900
really thought much about slaves I mean

544
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,150
I was total and Plato Socrates for sure

545
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,100
they didn't write really about it they

546
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,480
didn't even consider it a real issue

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,700
right not even noticeable

548
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,140
no yeah Dawkins wrote an essay

549
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,490
republished in his book the soul of

550
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,850
science I think about wanting to be a

551
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,970
vegetarian and he kind of went through

552
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,490
Peter singers famous arguments about the

553
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,710
expanding moral circle yeah well that

554
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,660
and he basically at the end he says I

555
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,030
know he's right and I know I shouldn't

556
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,770
do it but I go to a restaurant and I

557
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,050
can't help myself

558
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,430
you know it could be we need you know

559
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,550
everyone needs to change you know know

560
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,740
you need more than the arguments and you

561
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,590
need some kind of cultural momentum yes

562
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,720
and I mean that's why I took in my case

563
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,580
you know the in the death of my beloved

564
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,660
pet because you know I the taste of meat

565
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,850
is deep ingrained in our culture yeah so

566
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,560
it's just like with many of the other

567
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,090
isms we need to change our entire

568
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,370
culture why bring up children with all

569
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,920
this flesh all right here's your current

570
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,590
here's your current dog ah from your

571
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,300
from your perspective did you draw that

572
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,680
I know I had an artist oh yes because I

573
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,490
think movie

574
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,059
dog what's what's her name Ruby Ruby

575
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,929
yeah like the jewel yeah yeah right

576
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,640
anyway well I mean that's you know it's

577
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,470
one of those issues that I think

578
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,300
culturally will get there I think it's

579
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,559
going to take longer simply because

580
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,320
because we all have to eat and meat is

581
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,559
such a big factor you know it was easier

582
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,880
I think to give up slaves because not

583
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,920
that many people actually own slaves

584
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,870
everybody eats and everybody eats every

585
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,030
day and most people eat meat I think

586
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,040
it's just a harder moral revolution to

587
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,530
bring about I agree but there are some

588
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,720
promising development is impossible

589
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,450
impossible food there's your meat it's

590
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,220
getting more expensive and you know with

591
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,559
8 billion people it's not clear within

592
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,690
50 years from now we can still support

593
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,660
this mass ok culture given you know the

594
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,880
Associated environmental cost so maybe

595
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,610
things will will change I've been I've

596
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,620
been having the the impossible burger at

597
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,260
a local islands chain here in Santa

598
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,150
Barbara it's pretty good and I mean it's

599
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,650
a little expanding its 15 bucks or

600
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,880
something like that but the cost will

601
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,290
come down in time the council will come

602
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,809
down and apparently the impossible but

603
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:24,370
are they off it now at Burger King I

604
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,230
think it's the impossible West English

605
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,340
is I think they're calling the

606
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,990
impossible whopper yes and people can't

607
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,950
tell it apart so that's encouraging

608
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,130
yeah all right so this is the your

609
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,350
previous book was the about of romantic

610
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,440
what did you call yourself a romantic

611
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,720
consciousness a confession of a romantic

612
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,580
reduction projection a romantic

613
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,230
reductionist yeah yeah you've always

614
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,140
kind of flirted around with with not

615
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,890
being strictly reductionistic well and

616
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,790
yes

617
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,640
so that's entirely too very good and of

618
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
course in consciousness you have to take

619
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,690
a holistic perspective because

620
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,429
consciousness ultimately it's about a

621
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,780
whole you know w w o al e the whole here

622
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,600
and and because we you know my conscious

623
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,910
experience is holistic it's one it's not

624
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,830
many I don't experience many things at

625
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,540
any given point in time and so therefore

626
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,080
you have to ask what is a whole in in

627
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,030
your brain or anywhere else and and and

628
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,350
each whole concept

629
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,690
a conscious being a conscious thing a

630
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,340
conscious entity that has some

631
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,779
experiences yes yeah in the book you go

632
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,149
through these surgeries where they take

633
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,259
out different parts of the brain and

634
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,509
consciousness still is still retained

635
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:42,340
walk us through some of that research

636
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,470
and the search for where it's located

637
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,630
and why it's impossible to find it in

638
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,429
any one place well so so yeah so we do

639
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,340
know enough from new no clinical

640
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,679
neuroscience the last 150 years to know

641
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,409
there isn't any one place where sort of

642
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:01,179
it all comes together you know all my

643
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,100
conscious experience of me and not in

644
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,740
any one place they of course places in

645
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,629
the brain way if you have a stroke you

646
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,519
become unconscious but particularly in

647
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,679
the brainstem right so your brainstem as

648
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,809
like this to this pipe roughly two inch

649
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,789
a one inch thick to into the cause here

650
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,159
that connects the spinal cord with my

651
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,470
brain popper if you have a lesion there

652
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,090
you're typically in bad shape

653
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,450
right you may be in coma or or in a

654
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,250
persistent vegetative state but those

655
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,110
are just enabling factors just like you

656
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,460
need your heart to beat if your heart

657
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,649
doesn't beat within seven to ten seconds

658
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,720
you faint so that's one of the necessary

659
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
background condition same thing your

660
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,100
brainstem needs to all those neurons in

661
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,990
there need to be active in order to vote

662
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,970
for your for your really your cortex

663
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,190
it's really context the at the outermost

664
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,289
shell at least in as humans and in other

665
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:48,820
mammals that gives rise to anyone

666
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,429
conscious sensation and there we know

667
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:53,320
from people like Oliver Sacks you know

668
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,120
they're the neurologists yeah that

669
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,309
specific part of this cortical sheet

670
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:59,139
it's really like a pizza in assets like

671
00:25:59,139 --> 00:25:59,860
a pizza

672
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,179
it's a fourteen inch diameter two to

673
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,070
three millimeter thick and you've got

674
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,629
two of them and they're highly convolve

675
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:10,450
dand you know you know put into your

676
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,210
into your skull and different parts of

677
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,580
that mediate different aspects of

678
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,740
feeling feeling of self feeling of

679
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,289
seeing motion seeing of color of hearing

680
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,570
and we know this from people who have

681
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,940
strokes or lesion they miss they miss

682
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,759
entire entire categories of experience

683
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,429
they don't seem color anymore they they

684
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,919
feel everybody else is has it sort of

685
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,080
has been at a place they the loss of

686
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,649
feeling or familiarity and so so

687
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,029
clinical natural experiments like that

688
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,739
we know their specific parts of the but

689
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,169
of context that are really essential for

690
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,729
different classes of conscious

691
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,700
experiences yeah I was liked about

692
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,409
Oliver's books is you know basically

693
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,809
each chapter is something that's gone

694
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,059
wrong in somebody's brain and then what

695
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,519
that looks like in terms of symptoms and

696
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,219
experiences and behaviors and what it

697
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,539
actually feels like he's really very

698
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,580
good at conveying you know the feet you

699
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,519
know how does the world how does how

700
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,169
does your experience of the world change

701
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,999
if you have you know if you have these

702
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,889
specific brain lesion or you're unable

703
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:14,830
to remember or you always live live in

704
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,389
the present and that teaches us a lot

705
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:18,219
about consciousness there's another

706
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,849
class of surgeries so medical sciences

707
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,649
in general and surgeries probably taught

708
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:25,479
us more about consciousness and most

709
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:28,359
other fields so a series of experiments

710
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,159
that I know you know well that were done

711
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,589
at Caltech by a remember Joe bogan the

712
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:37,210
new search and and Michael Gazzaniga and

713
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,979
Laura Sperry you know who got a Nobel

714
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,629
Prize forth with these split brain

715
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,729
experiments yeah and so what happens in

716
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,289
a split brain experiment of course you

717
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,849
have a person who's epileptic seizure

718
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,669
the seizure might start in one cortical

719
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,009
hemisphere so seizure is just a hyper

720
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,129
you know hyper excitable above and

721
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,469
electrical activity that can if it

722
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:59,200
spreads can engulf the entire brain and

723
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,729
then you get these core model' you know

724
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,799
these attacks so to prevent it from

725
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,729
spreading as spreading a radical

726
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:08,649
therapies to cut the why the why is

727
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,509
there tuna if you look down at the brain

728
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:11,979
right it's like a walnut they're two

729
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:14,409
halves and the two halves are connected

730
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,179
by 200 million fibers called the corpus

731
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:20,830
callosum and if you cut that that yes

732
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,529
beautiful exactly and if you cut that

733
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:25,269
you can you can prevent the seizures

734
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,820
from and from spreading but then it

735
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,649
turns out now you have two minds in at

736
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:33,999
least some of these patients you have

737
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:36,489
two minds inside one scow you have the

738
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,679
left brain that gives rise to a mind and

739
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,869
that's the one that speaks but there was

740
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,239
a great discovery that the the the

741
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,549
speaking parts is really specialized in

742
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:46,779
most of us it's the left hemisphere

743
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:49,450
Bacchus they are in Veronica's area but

744
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,950
you can shut that off focus on by

745
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,259
initializing it by injecting sodium

746
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:53,900
amytal

747
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,210
and then there's the other mind in the

748
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,730
right hemisphere and they don't know

749
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,470
about each other it's like being on the

750
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,150
dark side of the moon there's someone in

751
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,309
my hair but it's not me you know like

752
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,380
the Pink Floyd it's on quite literally

753
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,250
because each one is its own experience

754
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,350
each one believes itself to be the only

755
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,470
thing inside their body but then of

756
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,300
course the patient you can ask the

757
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,740
patient and sometimes the patient

758
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,290
complains the patient she or he will say

759
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,210
oh my other hands always does things

760
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,670
that I don't want it to do right yeah

761
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,990
because it's the other consciousness

762
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,600
that have also a will of its own and

763
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,390
then they have to duke it out yeah it's

764
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,660
the problem of identity and self is

765
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,670
there a single self if you can so easily

766
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,570
divide a brain into two my so easily I

767
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,190
mean it is massive you know it's it's a

768
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,140
pretty rare surgery it's not it's not

769
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,670
done that even yeah but if you

770
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,130
physically cut the brain into two yes

771
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,350
then there will be at least this way not

772
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,730
this way but if you cut it this way

773
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,380
there will be two now you can do the

774
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,480
opposite also so this is what I talked

775
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,550
about so I can take your brain in my

776
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,920
brain and I can do sort of the very

777
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,780
opposite of split brain so I can start

778
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,000
putting in wires between let's see my

779
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,590
visual cortex and your visual cortex

780
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,410
okay so let's see I have some future you

781
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,120
know neural link Elon Musk like

782
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,670
technology that allows my visual cortex

783
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,070
to talk to your visual cortex so at

784
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,230
first what what the theory that I

785
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,660
discussed predicts at first I can see I

786
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,540
see normally like I see now but I also

787
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,490
see a little bit through your eyes so

788
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,010
what you see is like a ghostly image

789
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,320
like you know augmented reality

790
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,730
superimposed onto what I see but I'm

791
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,700
still me and you're still Michael now

792
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
with the theory predicts it's integrated

793
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,240
information theory predicts that as I

794
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,190
increase the bandwidth of this

795
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,260
connection as I add more and more fibers

796
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,960
this to this artificial brain bridge

797
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,780
between your brain and my brain at some

798
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,090
point and it's very precisely defined

799
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,420
when at some point abruptly I will die I

800
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,309
will disappear Christophe will be no

801
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:00,080
more Michael Shermer

802
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,090
will disappear instead there will be

803
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,700
this new thing this uber mind this new

804
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,649
conscious mind that has foot

805
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,379
in that houses that lives in to brain in

806
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,990
your brain and in my brain it has four

807
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,149
cortical hemisphere it's Sisu for eyes

808
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,669
and hears through four years and it

809
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,679
talks to two mouths but a different

810
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,179
world it'd be a completely different

811
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,049
experience well it still has some of you

812
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,879
it still has access to your memories

813
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,860
this mind still has access to my

814
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,620
memories of course it will have aspects

815
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,749
of your personality in my personality

816
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:36,029
there could be big Freud's going on but

817
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,370
it will be a single mind just like the

818
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,029
bog the e there will be a single mind

819
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:43,710
you know I'll call it Michael Christophe

820
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,740
you know some some amalgamation of your

821
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,350
mind and in my mind there's always only

822
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,539
a single consciousness and then as I

823
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,460
progressively reduce that there's

824
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,860
bandwidth these wires between my and

825
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,440
your brain at some point abruptly you

826
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,119
will find yourself back in your brain

827
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,909
and I will find myself back in in my

828
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:05,639
brain the sensor I showed this picture

829
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:10,200
of your dog Ruby through your eyes you

830
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,429
know sort of looking down you can see

831
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,080
your legs and there's Ruby for those who

832
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,330
are just listening to this podcast if

833
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,600
you had a brain link between your visual

834
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,940
cortex and your dog's visual cortex

835
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,519
if you cranked up the electricity enough

836
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,490
would she suddenly see that almost like

837
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,919
looking in the mirror like there I am it

838
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,559
would well if it's a single mine it

839
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,990
would be a sort of a weird canine human

840
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,960
mind we would be fused yes it's it's

841
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,009
it's a very weird that is really spooky

842
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:44,490
I mean it's it's easier to think about

843
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,610
it yeah you know so for example when

844
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,990
you're making love you must have

845
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,879
realizes you know so you're making loves

846
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,769
you you're sort of your bodies are

847
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,899
interpenetrated but you realize that she

848
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,759
is assuming you're making love to a

849
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,190
woman that she is still her own mind and

850
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,899
you're still your mind and you can look

851
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,610
at each other but you can never bridge

852
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,679
that gap right mind the captors always

853
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,200
care now with brain bridging this the

854
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,299
the theory says if I directly connect my

855
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,940
pride mum my brain was harebrained and

856
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,409
at some point there will only be a

857
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,720
single mind we will truly be merged like

858
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,909
lavas there will only be one mind like

859
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:19,299
Kristen is older you know

860
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,330
in in in Varanasi eponymous opera there

861
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,980
will be one mind there will be no more

862
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,059
and there will only be twisting is olden

863
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,200
you know that I think it was a New

864
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,320
Yorker cartoon of two behaviorists after

865
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,539
making love the one says you know you

866
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:36,340
had a really great time how was it for

867
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,740
me

868
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,799
[Laughter]

869
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,809
know this now interesting this might

870
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,789
happen already on this planet there are

871
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,679
twins I'm thinking right now of

872
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,190
identical to Siamese twins in Canada mmm

873
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,869
yeah in north of us here in British

874
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,119
Columbia and they were born with what's

875
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,129
called a brain bridge and salami brain

876
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:59,889
bridge so due to some birth defect their

877
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:02,230
brains never really truly separated into

878
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,529
into two brains and there's some so the

879
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:07,720
New York Times you know Gordon long

880
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,879
article about it and there's some

881
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,649
evidence that one of the girls can look

882
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,690
there the other girl can look over the

883
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,210
end can partly see through the eyes of

884
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,909
her of her you know Siamese twin partly

885
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,359
because of this of this bridge so for

886
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,270
the one looking that's just such a weird

887
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,549
idea so they're really getting different

888
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:33,190
inputs and combining them into some kind

889
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,500
of field and I mean it I'm envisioning

890
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,569
some kind of a split field but but a

891
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:39,579
bird that has to you know eyes on either

892
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,690
side of its head

893
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,839
it I think of it like augmented reality

894
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,669
at that point right you know the

895
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,440
portable augmented reality for where

896
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,270
this car I see I see still the real

897
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,129
reality but then I have these virtual

898
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:53,980
images that are that are super that are

899
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,780
superimposed except here they are not

900
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,420
virtual they are again they're they're

901
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,400
real but at some point if there's only

902
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,220
one mind then this is your experience of

903
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,140
the world you explain you see the world

904
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,640
through four eyes I mean invincible yes

905
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,319
we we are of course only used to seeing

906
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,059
the world for two eyes but in principle

907
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,170
you can imagine how I see the world

908
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,740
soulful eyes a single conscious view is

909
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,960
singer mind maybe this would be so the

910
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,730
augmented reality may solve the problem

911
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,589
Thomas Nagel is what it's like to be a

912
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,020
bat yeah we can just actually put the

913
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,240
goggles on and they give the Aquila

914
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,090
sonar and you're now not a bad you

915
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,340
that couldn't you know your badge human

916
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,960
which is different from the pure path

917
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,940
that's true right so in that sense I

918
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,680
will never know really what a what

919
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,290
Justin bath is by itself because my

920
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,180
brain is different and so my brain

921
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,670
cannot be you know the brain of a bat

922
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,950
the most the most of that would happen

923
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,690
you'd just be a bat wondering what it's

924
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,380
like to be a human or something like

925
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,170
that I had a lot of experience with

926
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,460
virtual reality but I was at a

927
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,790
conference recently where the the

928
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,940
virtual reality goggles helmet thing was

929
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,480
a image from a hundred and ten story

930
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,850
building in LA or wherever it was

931
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,850
looking down on a plank sticking out of

932
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,770
the window and you walk out on the plank

933
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,540
so just standing there watching the guy

934
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,540
you know they were gonna if you can last

935
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,220
the whole two minutes or whatever it was

936
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,080
and you can walk actually walk all the

937
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,610
way out to the end you get some little

938
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,200
present whatever they were giving away

939
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,140
and and it to me it looked ridiculous of

940
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,760
course I could do this anybody could do

941
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,010
it because you know that the plank is

942
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,660
actually sitting on the floor one inch

943
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,720
above the carpeting but the moment I put

944
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,120
it on it's like I can't do it I am NOT

945
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,800
gonna be able to make it out there even

946
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,660
closing my eyes I would just kind of

947
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,280
open them a little bit in peak and you

948
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,320
know I'm looking 110 stories down it's

949
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,440
like I can't do it ourselves it's really

950
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,360
interesting it shows how that visual in

951
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,000
our case because we are visual creatures

952
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,070
visual input can override our prefrontal

953
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,620
cortex knowledge as you said you know

954
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,150
perfectly well there's no danger there

955
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,730
but the visual input sometimes it's even

956
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,170
more powerful when it's combined did

957
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,200
they have like sounds of wind no there

958
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,970
was no sound it was just just a visual

959
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,220
yeah the visual input by itself is so

960
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,380
powerful it can override your knowledge

961
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,480
it's like visual illusions idea I mean

962
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,620
you know this again there are these

963
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,480
powerful visual illusions you perfectly

964
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,430
well know you're being fooled but you

965
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,850
cannot not see the illusion my favorite

966
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,530
is Jerry Jerry Jerry Andrus is

967
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,140
impossible create illusion where yeah

968
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,980
yeah did the actual create built yes you

969
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,960
perfectly well know that it you know it

970
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,850
can't look like that but your brains

971
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,760
fools you because that knowledge isn't

972
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,310
sufficient to break the the individual

973
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,410
percept yeah

974
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,410
so what so the the musk mind-link or

975
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,390
whatever that's this thing is gonna do I

976
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,920
haven't really followed it that closely

977
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,049
uh but the moment they say you know

978
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,339
we're just gonna open up your brain and

979
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,720
stick this thing in there it's like wait

980
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,079
time out that's fairly risky surgery to

981
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,359
do that right just you know take open up

982
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,009
the skullcap and put something in there

983
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,990
and then put it back on that's not a

984
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,299
that's not a trivial thing to do correct

985
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:08,029
and so right now and for the foreseeable

986
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:11,220
next decade or two or three that risk

987
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,799
profile is only worth it if you have you

988
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,809
know if you're paralyzed or you know

989
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,119
Hemi player Parkinson's disease or no

990
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,009
toxin disease or you know if they're

991
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,720
significant if you're significantly

992
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,750
impaired all this augmentation right now

993
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,819
it's just simply too risky and no search

994
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,859
and in the at least in the West would

995
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,450
would do that because it's simply too

996
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,130
risky there's always a chance of

997
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,839
bleeding there's obviously a chance of

998
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,369
of infection etc and so you only do that

999
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,140
you know if you if they're strong

1000
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,680
reasons to justify those risks yeah so I

1001
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,500
mean if you had contact lenses that had

1002
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,380
access to the internet or glasses or

1003
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,700
something like that that seems fairly

1004
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,059
easy to do a cochlear implant you know

1005
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:56,339
that seems far far less invasive than

1006
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:00,299
then what musk is proposing yes but you

1007
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,400
know they people have done this now

1008
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,890
brain machine interfaces in fact that's

1009
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,710
also what knurling wants to do for

1010
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,119
quadriplegic so these are people you

1011
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,009
know wherever high up lesion in their

1012
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,259
spinal cord who are you know can move

1013
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:16,009
any of the limbs and so in that case

1014
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,750
it's worth it you know in order for you

1015
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,549
to control a wheelchair or to control

1016
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:23,819
your you and your phone right so that's

1017
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,029
that's such a great example of arthur c

1018
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,380
clarke third law you know any

1019
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,950
sufficiently advanced technology for

1020
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,259
magic so all Geo's you see is this guy

1021
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:36,240
is sitting there any and then things

1022
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,130
start moving as he's thinking about him

1023
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,319
well that looks like telekinesis unless

1024
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,420
you know the the brain ship that's in

1025
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,329
there how far is that come along since

1026
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,009
it's still so you know if you look at

1027
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,259
there are a few cases of these patients

1028
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,859
online but then you you know it takes a

1029
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,470
team of three four five six engineers

1030
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,240
and three PhD students

1031
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,430
a lot of support and you have to go in

1032
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,980
the clinic and you know it takes you

1033
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,990
sort of five minutes to take a single

1034
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,480
sip from a straw so it's still very much

1035
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,369
in its infancy but it's like any other

1036
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,770
medical technology right early on all of

1037
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,350
these things like contact lenses are

1038
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,400
incredible primitive and then as

1039
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,230
technology gets relentless better you

1040
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,640
know these things will be easier to use

1041
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,360
but as you pointed out any time you go

1042
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,190
in vase if you go inside the body the

1043
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,710
risk you know increases dramatically and

1044
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,740
so that'll slow down any any technology

1045
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,470
so adoption for most of us who are who

1046
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,619
have not actually augmentation versus

1047
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,560
just replacing a loss function it's

1048
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,220
still a ways away yeah yeah now when I

1049
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,380
read that I remembered my mom had

1050
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,619
meningioma brain tumors and you know at

1051
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,300
the moment they did brain surgery I

1052
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,060
think she had to take like anti stroke

1053
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,700
medications and and other medications

1054
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,760
for the rest of her life yes just by

1055
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,830
opening up the skull well she did she

1056
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,260
had five craniometry these tumors kept

1057
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,280
growing back and and then five radiation

1058
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,560
treatments when they wouldn't operate on

1059
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,390
the brain anymore and she felt Amelie

1060
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,010
died of this but she was in a coma she

1061
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,050
eventually she fell and hit her head

1062
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,880
when she wasn't functioning too well and

1063
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,580
was in a coma but so I was you know

1064
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,750
reading your whole section here on

1065
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,940
people in comas and or vegetative States

1066
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,180
and so on and same kind of things so

1067
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,740
many people experience I would hold her

1068
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,540
hand and say squeeze my hand

1069
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,950
you know and then she would do it pretty

1070
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,430
much every time so what can we conclude

1071
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,770
from I mean the lights are on a little

1072
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,450
bit you know the dimmer has come up just

1073
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,520
a little bit if she's responding in some

1074
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,869
way or is that just more like a

1075
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:44,119
knee-jerk reflex with a verbal command

1076
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,490
ultimately it's difficult to know but

1077
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,750
general the assumption is if it's you

1078
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,130
know if you ask me if you hear me

1079
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,770
squeeze my hand or you can also ask you

1080
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,330
can ask him more objective knowledge you

1081
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,040
know where you born in Kansas City or

1082
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,170
not so people do those sorts of X you

1083
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,000
know trying to communicate well you know

1084
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,130
what the answer is and you see is it

1085
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,400
just a reflex every time the the the

1086
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,260
brain here's a command it just squeezes

1087
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,359
or is it much more sophisticated more

1088
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,920
challenging a case

1089
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,340
what's called minimal conscious MCs

1090
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,530
state or vegetative state where you

1091
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,450
don't even get that where no matter what

1092
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,370
you ask or you ask them to move their

1093
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,580
eyes there's no response and there are a

1094
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,770
few thousand of those patients and you

1095
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,270
simply don't know whether there's

1096
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,310
anybody home and then you need these

1097
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,620
this technology that I described in this

1098
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,210
book there's so called zap and zip or

1099
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,520
you when you stimulate the brain it's a

1100
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,050
little bit like you take a bell and you

1101
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,940
hit it with a hammer and you're looking

1102
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,130
at the reverberation and based on the

1103
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,110
complexity of those who are vibration by

1104
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,270
that you pick up using eg you can

1105
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,010
ascertain whether the brain is still

1106
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,230
conscious or whether it's truly in an

1107
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,820
unconscious state like in a deep

1108
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,830
anesthesia or in a vegetative state when

1109
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,840
truly no one is home anymore you still

1110
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,430
have the shell of the body like you

1111
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,800
remember Terry Schiavo yeah she she

1112
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,210
didn't even have a brain wasn't it just

1113
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,300
mush or just mostly you know I don't

1114
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,680
know she had a brain so she had an

1115
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,750
anoxia for 25 minutes before she was

1116
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,850
revived and put on a on a on a

1117
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,160
ventilator and post-mortem they turned

1118
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,320
out the brain at shrank by by a great

1119
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,080
deal by more than half 50% but she did

1120
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,670
have a brain and of course like many of

1121
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,980
these patient in a vegetative state she

1122
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,140
has occasionally these responses you

1123
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,930
know where she would move she and the

1124
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,280
eyes occasionally would move

1125
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,470
occasionally she would grimace you know

1126
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,330
it's very good see she laughing or

1127
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,730
crying or what so she clearly had some

1128
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,890
reflexes so so there's a difference

1129
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,780
between brain dead when you have no

1130
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,330
reflexes whatsoever and vegetative state

1131
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,700
patience when you when they okay they

1132
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,410
will open their eyes occasionally they

1133
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,540
will they will move brain that patient

1134
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,130
doesn't have any of that right so what

1135
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,710
can you assume that in terms of

1136
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,240
personhood or sentence said brain state

1137
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,190
as fast we can tell if your brain is

1138
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,090
dead you're dead

1139
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,070
yeah your body may still be alive

1140
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,400
although that's disputed but if your

1141
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,810
brain is dead there's no one home

1142
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,910
anymore and if you're honest um at the

1143
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,590
modern definition of death it used to be

1144
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,440
death a sensation of breathing sensation

1145
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,080
of of pulse right but now we know that's

1146
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,360
unique I can animate you right we people

1147
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,550
invented in the 1950s ventilator so now

1148
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,630
I can keep your body

1149
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,570
live almost indefinitely so now we we

1150
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,270
define deaths edom cut your palm mean

1151
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,010
our death or a brain deaths if your

1152
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,780
death if your brain is irreversible

1153
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,880
broken then you're not home anymore

1154
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,460
yeah although to your loved one you know

1155
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,620
you might still look a lot you know

1156
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,690
alive you have skin pala your your body

1157
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,820
is warm your you know your your your

1158
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,590
chest goes in and out but that's because

1159
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,170
you're on a ventilator right well but

1160
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,580
but I'm thinking of that that in between

1161
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,590
state the coma state they squeeze my

1162
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,350
hand and they do or whatever what is

1163
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,600
well if they do then they are then they

1164
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,190
are fully then they're there how much

1165
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,690
are they there you know are they just

1166
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,180
mainly there right are they just sort of

1167
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,920
in asleep most of the time and

1168
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,750
occasionally they wake up for an hour -

1169
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,870
very difficult to to tell and with

1170
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,640
technologies interesting you know again

1171
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,170
50 years ago those people all would have

1172
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,210
died very quickly but it was more than

1173
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,370
you know 911 emergency it asks you

1174
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,070
helicopters modern trauma surgery we can

1175
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,780
pull some of them back and most of them

1176
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,790
you know we you can we can return to

1177
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,740
normal life but then there's this subset

1178
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,230
of patients who's so gravely injured

1179
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,060
they I'm not there but they're not fully

1180
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,370
alive they are sort of you know hovering

1181
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,410
in this unfortunate State and of course

1182
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,940
with modern technology you can keep

1183
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,580
their body alive for a decade was it the

1184
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,920
Terri Schiavo case where the the husband

1185
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,540
wanted to pull the plug and the parents

1186
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,060
didn't or is it right yeah it was

1187
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,070
litigated all the way up to the Supreme

1188
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,840
Court a member of Congress met on the

1189
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,490
weekend and the Supreme Court major

1190
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,360
George Bush got involved yeah W Bush but

1191
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,120
yeah so but that's not exception as I

1192
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,650
said there are thousands of cases like

1193
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,310
that mainly interesting homes hospices

1194
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,980
etc and it's a great time it's it's a

1195
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,360
great tragedy for everyone

1196
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:12,570
yeah yeah right and then general

1197
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,290
anesthesia

1198
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,240
where does your consciousness or your

1199
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,150
sentience go well it seemed pleased with

1200
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,790
it goes when in deep sleep he's gone

1201
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,630
it's benign it's simply it's not there

1202
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,670
anymore because your you know your brain

1203
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,440
is now in a different state you're

1204
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,520
simply not not conscious that's what

1205
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,950
defines states of unconsciousness yeah

1206
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,490
yeah and then when you come the magic

1207
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,470
you know you wake up you know I can I

1208
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,390
can ask you Michael Michael and then you

1209
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,640
come food and suddenly you it kind of

1210
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,610
the lights come back on the lights come

1211
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,740
back on again yeah the one enough at all

1212
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,760
yes yeah

1213
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,380
all right so walk us through this this

1214
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,510
latest theory of you know neural

1215
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,950
correlates of consciousness and the

1216
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:02,000
information processing and all that well

1217
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,980
I mean it's not it so they are really

1218
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,150
two sort of popular scientific theories

1219
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,170
scientific theories of consciousness

1220
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,900
around one is the the global neuronal

1221
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,480
works P theorem that essentially says

1222
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,150
sort of it's a funkiest account that

1223
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,310
essentially says consciousness is a

1224
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,200
performance of certain function

1225
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,420
involving short-term memory involving

1226
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,850
planning involving self-monitoring and

1227
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,310
and those things are implemented in

1228
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,860
particular parts of the brain and also

1229
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,020
once you replicate those functions on a

1230
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,810
machine you know including monitoring

1231
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,390
self having planning having ability to

1232
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,850
speak etc then you will get a conscious

1233
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,790
a conscious machine the other popular

1234
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,320
theory is called integrated information

1235
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,350
theory is by this psychiatrist and your

1236
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:51,770
scientist Giulio Tononi and I'm a big

1237
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,180
fan I've worked with them for many years

1238
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,609
that says no consciousness is more

1239
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,280
fundamental consciousness it's different

1240
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,230
from its material underpinning it's a

1241
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,600
distinct difference thing in fact it's

1242
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,950
the only thing that I have directly

1243
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,910
acquaintance with and and really has to

1244
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,970
do altom Utley was with was a complexity

1245
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,700
of any physical system ultimately it has

1246
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,480
to do with with with the ability of any

1247
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,930
physical system to to causally influence

1248
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,600
itself ultimately it's about intrinsic

1249
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,180
causal powers it's it's something else

1250
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,240
total said 2003 not years ago you exist

1251
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,400
you're conscious to them to the extent

1252
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,950
that you have that your brain the thing

1253
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,780
that is conscious has causal power upon

1254
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,060
itself that means it can be influenced

1255
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,740
by its previous state and it can

1256
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,810
influence it can determine its future

1257
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,820
state or self-referential

1258
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,530
in some events a causal power ultimately

1259
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,420
how do I know anything exists it really

1260
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,260
goes back to

1261
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,660
two fundamental ontological

1262
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,800
consideration how do I know anything

1263
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,130
exists I only know things exist by the

1264
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,710
influence they have on me so gravity I

1265
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,330
know it exists because there's tides

1266
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,330
there's a famous Apple you know of Isaac

1267
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,460
Newton that's how I that's how we know

1268
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,780
ultimately gravity exists now this

1269
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,760
theory applies causation to itself you

1270
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,369
exist to the X you exist as a thing as a

1271
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,770
conscious thing to the extent that you

1272
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,869
that you have causal power upon your own

1273
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,090
system and the more causal power you

1274
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,520
have the more complex the system is the

1275
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,350
more you exist the more you're conscious

1276
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,240
and and and there are certain

1277
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,280
consequences that you can test in

1278
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,119
different dreams yeah and then it uses

1279
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,859
something like that in his book freedom

1280
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:39,770
evolves where he argues for something

1281
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,560
like free will or volition as a function

1282
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,500
of the complexity of the organism to do

1283
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,600
what you're describing so the more of

1284
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,300
that you have the freer you are or you

1285
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,890
didn't say that he said the the more

1286
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,260
degrees of freedom you have to make

1287
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,090
choices within your environment to move

1288
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,940
around and affect things and in the case

1289
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,160
of humans we can self reflect on that

1290
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,810
and know that these are the things that

1291
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,520
cause me to do certain things so I'm

1292
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,700
gonna change my behavior to redirect

1293
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,890
that causal vector to do something else

1294
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,510
that I know it will have that effect and

1295
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,520
so on and so on in a self referential

1296
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,280
way it's correct but of course Dan

1297
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,700
Dennett

1298
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,560
also fundamentally believes that there

1299
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,930
isn't anything like consciousness itself

1300
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,150
that's really a big illusion in in his

1301
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,859
eyes we're really confused about it

1302
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:27,140
ultimately consciousness is just a set

1303
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,920
of behavioral dispositions ultimately

1304
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,359
consciousness is a function I carry out

1305
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:34,520
a whole set of functions I carry out and

1306
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,320
once again once you implement those

1307
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,940
function in a different system like a

1308
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,280
computer that system will be conscious

1309
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,580
so in that sense I this runs radical

1310
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,010
contrary to his notion or the general

1311
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,250
notion that's that such a myth in in

1312
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,920
anglo-american University departments

1313
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,710
and in big tech that ultimately machines

1314
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,020
will be conscious because hey once he

1315
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,640
can do everything we can do then of

1316
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,260
course they're gonna be conscious and I

1317
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,830
think this couldn't be more wrong well

1318
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:04,930
then Howard yes

1319
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,250
how would they how would you ever know

1320
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,339
the machine was conscious well okay so

1321
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:13,300
so okay so let's take this apart it is

1322
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,630
true if you if you think about

1323
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,030
intelligence intelligence ultimately

1324
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,040
it's about behavior it's about function

1325
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,559
and there's no question at least in

1326
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:26,230
principle machines can do anything we

1327
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,270
can doing including being creative and

1328
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,190
speaking and talking and all those other

1329
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,720
things where selves we are gonna be able

1330
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,329
to write novels pretty soon at some

1331
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,430
point yeah you can go to open may I and

1332
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,859
you can use that GPT algorithm and it

1333
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:41,520
generates pretty cool you know text pose

1334
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,200
but that's there but but those are all

1335
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,359
about functions yeah so there so

1336
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:47,920
intelligence ultimately it's about

1337
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,829
behaviors about function consciousness

1338
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:52,990
is not about function it's not a state

1339
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,940
it doesn't have to it doesn't relate to

1340
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,309
function it's it's ultimately being it's

1341
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,430
ultimately a state of being and yes in

1342
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,410
evolved creatures function and

1343
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,599
intelligence and continents usually

1344
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:05,980
evolve together but you can certainly

1345
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,990
artificially separate them and so you

1346
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,599
can build a machine like deep mind or

1347
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,970
you know Alexa you know 20 point

1348
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,230
oh and fifty years from now that's

1349
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,359
incredible smart smarter than you and I

1350
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:18,849
but it won't feel like anything to be

1351
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,530
this machine which is very different

1352
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,940
from consciousness here which is

1353
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,880
ultimately about being yeah my favorite

1354
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,290
example of this is meeting David

1355
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,720
Ferrucci the designer of Watson the

1356
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,390
computer program that won jeopardy yes

1357
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,430
so I asked him miss Watson know that he

1358
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,990
won jeopardy I mean was he just totally

1359
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,000
excited that he beat Ken Jennings and

1360
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,309
and Brad Rutter and and and he's the

1361
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:40,750
world champ no of course he doesn't even

1362
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,280
know that he's playing jeopardy doesn't

1363
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,920
even know what jeopardy is is it's just

1364
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,569
an algorithm grinding through Wikipedia

1365
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:48,609
pages to find the you know best

1366
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:50,890
inference to the likeliest answer and so

1367
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,380
forth yeah but most people Michael don't

1368
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,089
have that into it most people say well I

1369
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,130
mean dantana would suddenly say well not

1370
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,930
what's maybe but if you make Watson you

1371
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,180
know sophisticated enough it does all

1372
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,740
these computation yeah of course it's

1373
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,000
conscious because what else has

1374
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,530
consciousness and carrying out a bunch

1375
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,049
of functions so that's what what I mean

1376
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:09,880
by but by my subtitle of my book

1377
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,190
consciousness can't be computed it's not

1378
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,250
just a simple computation so even if you

1379
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,319
made a supercomputer simulation of

1380
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,700
assumed being including

1381
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,920
of its nuance that's just a computer

1382
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,770
program that doesn't mean it's conscious

1383
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,200
just like a weather simulation doesn't

1384
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,940
make it wet right if you simulate a

1385
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,310
rainstorm it's not wet inside the deer

1386
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,660
hunt yeah yeah of course all the

1387
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,109
different things but we are machines

1388
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:37,300
I mean we're made of molecules atoms and

1389
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,280
molecules that's a machine that's

1390
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,050
correct so in principle you're entirely

1391
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,060
correct so my brain as I say it's a

1392
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,560
piece of furniture like any other

1393
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,170
furniture okay it is - it is by far the

1394
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,300
most complex piece of active matter in

1395
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,050
the known universe

1396
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,650
and so ultimately that if I want to get

1397
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,450
a conscious if I want to build a

1398
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,000
conscious machine I have to build it in

1399
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,119
the image of man so you do what's called

1400
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,070
neuromorphic engineering you build an

1401
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,780
IBM has a project like that you're

1402
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,390
actually trying to build neural hardware

1403
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,940
neurons that have this massive overlap

1404
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,010
in the input in the output that don't

1405
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,359
talk to us - three or four transistors

1406
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,660
but talk to 10,000 transistors yes so in

1407
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,300
principle you can get a machine that has

1408
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,339
human level consciousness but not

1409
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:23,920
digital programmable machines right now

1410
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,260
because their architecture at the level

1411
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,480
of the metal of the actual wires at the

1412
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,240
actual gates is vastly simpler than our

1413
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,599
plane yeah but if we a so we just apply

1414
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:36,670
a Moore's law out front on another

1415
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,530
century or two and eventually we get

1416
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:42,060
human level complexity it's still kill

1417
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,569
no no so so yes you'll get human level

1418
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:48,760
intelligence I'm not disputing that but

1419
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,069
ultimately look conscience ultimately

1420
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:52,690
it's a physical thing it has to do with

1421
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,300
the complexity of the of the ultimate

1422
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,730
Hardware not with a behavior so you have

1423
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,319
to ask if you actually look at the CPU

1424
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,630
you look at its wiring you have one

1425
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,220
transistor gate that's typically hooked

1426
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,930
up to three or four other gate or other

1427
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,359
transistors whose very little overlap my

1428
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,579
brain is radical different my brain has

1429
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:11,260
one neuron that's connected with 50

1430
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,510
thousand other neurons in the

1431
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,819
neighboring you're may share 40,000 of

1432
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,589
those inputs and outputs enabling one

1433
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:20,859
may share 39,000 it's a it's a radical

1434
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,780
different architecture this architecture

1435
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,819
all evolved architecture really gives

1436
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:27,250
rise to a high level of internal of

1437
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:32,230
offer of intrinsic causal powers which

1438
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,730
the theory is what consciousness is

1439
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,920
which is very difficult it different

1440
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,020
from simulating it in a digital program

1441
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,210
on a vastly simpler machine no matter

1442
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,750
how big this machine is so then again if

1443
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,940
we're if we're a machine then how is it

1444
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,460
that it happened with us but it can't

1445
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,940
happen in a computer it cannot it could

1446
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,829
happen in a computer if you build it in

1447
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:56,619
the right way I said because the way we

1448
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,750
build our machines is not to give rise

1449
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,480
to consciousness and it is to do simple

1450
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,160
things over and over and over and over

1451
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,040
again right if you put in your tax

1452
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,510
return or doing all these other things

1453
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:09,250
that's what machines excel at and

1454
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,480
they'll get better at it and ultimately

1455
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,609
they may be smarter than us but that's

1456
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:14,770
very different from actually having an

1457
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,579
experience

1458
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:18,700
look there's a great metaphor or great

1459
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,290
analogy so I have a friend she's an

1460
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,480
astrophysicist she writes down the

1461
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,849
equation of general relativity to

1462
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,440
simulate the black hole at the center of

1463
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,140
the galaxy okay you know that there's a

1464
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,550
there's a black hole at the center of

1465
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,380
our galaxy it's roughly a million solar

1466
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,359
masses but funny

1467
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:36,700
she is not concerned that she's gonna be

1468
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,980
sucked into the black hole when she

1469
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,349
writes out the equation now why is that

1470
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:42,940
it's a perfectly good it's a best

1471
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,460
simulation invincible off of the power

1472
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,040
of gravity yet where's the difference

1473
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,079
why doesn't she get sucked into it

1474
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,060
because it doesn't have the caller power

1475
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,579
of gravity just because you simulate the

1476
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:57,069
equations of general relativity does not

1477
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:58,780
mean that you get the cause of power

1478
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,940
that goes hand-in-hand with spending

1479
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,160
space-time you know it's that mass does

1480
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,140
same thing with constants just because

1481
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,180
you simulate some of the behavior so she

1482
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,460
was conscious does not mean you get the

1483
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,079
same causal power that consciousness

1484
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,690
Houston I got you okay so you're a Star

1485
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,780
Trek fan data could never be a person in

1486
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,849
in the sentient way that we are well

1487
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:22,960
know I don't know what is hot ways in ex

1488
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,150
machina right you know it's suggested

1489
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,010
there's some sort of neuromorphic brain

1490
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,300
you know it's never really explained

1491
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,250
yeah yeah if it's if it's if it's

1492
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,560
similar to the architecture of our brain

1493
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,000
yes it could be conscious could even be

1494
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,359
more conscious than I am okay so it has

1495
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,640
to do with the purpose of the design

1496
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,099
what are you doing able to do not the

1497
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:44,390
purpose it has to do with the actual

1498
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:47,030
and the actual you have to look inside

1499
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,020
the box yeah

1500
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,760
actually look at the hardware you know

1501
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,619
there's stuff that actually does these

1502
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:53,810
transformation and you have to ask how

1503
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,520
complex is that using this specific

1504
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,470
measure called Phi you can actually

1505
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,109
compute for any particular piece of for

1506
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,430
any physical system you can actually

1507
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,650
compute how much fired hasn't principal

1508
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,720
it's it's totally computable it's not

1509
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,670
some very very mysterious stuff although

1510
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,080
maybe this cause of power it's the only

1511
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,839
thing that exists yeah so tell us what

1512
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,010
fire is again so so much of thi your ph

1513
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,290
are the Greek letter it's it's it's a

1514
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,750
measure of officer it's a single number

1515
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,650
between zero and and any positive number

1516
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,720
if it's zero the system doesn't exist

1517
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,730
for job is not conscious has no powerful

1518
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,250
power pond itself the larger this number

1519
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,000
is the theory said it's really a

1520
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,260
quantity of consciousness if you want it

1521
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,849
doesn't describe the qualia it doesn't

1522
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,130
describe whether it's a smell or you

1523
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,230
know the feeling of life itself or the

1524
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,690
seeing red and so for that you need

1525
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,460
different measures but fine self just

1526
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,980
characterizes the the irreducibility of

1527
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,660
the system how much the system exists

1528
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,820
for itself ultimately it's sort of the

1529
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,349
quantity of consciousness of that

1530
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:57,950
particular system yeah so in my my last

1531
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,480
book Kevin's on earth I have a chapter

1532
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,940
devoted to the the people trying to

1533
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,460
upload the mind the cingulate Aryans and

1534
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,640
all that so I met this you know this

1535
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,150
group that that are trying to not copy

1536
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,359
the connectome in a in a scanning kind

1537
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:16,670
of way they they want to actually they

1538
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:20,540
sacrifice like a sheep brain froze it

1539
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,050
and then and then sliced it up and then

1540
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,910
scanned you know scanning electron

1541
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,680
microscope of each of these slices with

1542
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,570
the the idea at some point you'd have a

1543
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,910
digital file that represents every sit

1544
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,310
this is a group in Cambridge right yeah

1545
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,800
yeah well yeah there's a couple groups

1546
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,240
there there was one that was doing this

1547
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,580
at a at a at a lab in Fontana California

1548
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,369
21st century medicine that their main

1549
00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:49,280
job is is organ preservation organ

1550
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,990
transplants and so on but then they also

1551
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,730
have this little subdivision I'm not

1552
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,589
sure they're still doing this but where

1553
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:57,300
they would freeze freeze a brain

1554
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,430
you know sacrifice the animals and then

1555
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,240
infuse it with a president preservation

1556
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,410
you know antifreeze so that water

1557
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,910
freezing doesn't shatter the neurons and

1558
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,970
then unfreeze it and slice it up and

1559
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,070
then you can see that the synaptic

1560
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,070
connections are still viable so this was

1561
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,050
for them a proof of concept that you

1562
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,810
could be if you could do it properly

1563
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:23,850
with cryonics although they still have a

1564
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,580
ways to go on this in principle the

1565
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,980
memory self so they're defining the self

1566
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,460
as your memories and I have a problem

1567
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,570
with that because I think we're more

1568
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,250
than our memories we're also our point

1569
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,320
of view self through the eyes cell from

1570
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,640
one moment to the next

1571
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,090
and copying the connectome and then

1572
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,010
turning it on somewhere else or putting

1573
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,170
it in a digital file into the cloud

1574
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,720
that's not going to be you it's not your

1575
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,310
point of view looking through your eyes

1576
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,580
self it's not your consciousness Michael

1577
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,110
that's right it's not your consciousness

1578
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,180
so leap yes leaving aside all

1579
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,650
technological problems you'll be

1580
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,210
actually doing this we have a project

1581
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,880
here at the Allens dude funded by the

1582
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,250
Aiyappa where for the first time we cut

1583
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,800
up at electron microscopic level with

1584
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,260
3.5 nanometer resolution a complete

1585
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,290
cubic millimeter off a bra of a mouse

1586
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,640
brain you know it's a it's a few

1587
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,330
petabytes leaving aside all practical

1588
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,440
methodological technological

1589
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,080
consideration the theory very clearly

1590
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,510
says if use run the simulation on a

1591
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,210
digital cloud it's all fake

1592
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,680
consciousness it won't feel like

1593
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,690
anything it's digital rapture for nerds

1594
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,940
and your your app into nothingness

1595
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,460
yes so it's not you know it's nothing

1596
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,350
it's nothing it's not even a thing it's

1597
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,810
not even its self conscious correct it

1598
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,730
wouldn't be a copy of you thinking I'm

1599
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,350
the real Christoph Kok and that other

1600
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,810
guy down there is just a copy correct

1601
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,520
but you know I'm sure people will do it

1602
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,870
because you know we're desperate to

1603
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,090
cheat death in any which way and so you

1604
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,400
know the finalists build this gigantic

1605
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,320
pyramid so of course a modern version of

1606
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,940
it you're gonna do the connectome yes

1607
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,240
did you ever see that I usually a bigger

1608
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,130
part there was a documentary film made

1609
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,569
on Ray Kurzweil called the

1610
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:12,559
is it the aterna no not the immortal

1611
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,240
list it was the single yeah no not the

1612
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,309
singularity is near this was on his

1613
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:23,510
personal life and in any case it sort of

1614
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,760
follows him around of course he has a

1615
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,530
whole basement in his home devoted to

1616
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:30,589
his father his father died at age 51 you

1617
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:32,270
know and so he's keeping as much

1618
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,579
information as he can that will be part

1619
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:38,690
of the reconstructed essentially

1620
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,730
resurrection really that's the right

1621
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,700
word resurrection of his father but of

1622
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,010
course the father isn't there it's just

1623
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,050
you're interacting with a copy of that's

1624
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,160
closer than a memory photo book say a

1625
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,859
photo album people want to reach

1626
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:56,990
immortality any which way and this is

1627
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,940
the modern way of doing it's not that

1628
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,040
different from the photo you know having

1629
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,559
his slaves and and you know all of his

1630
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:05,780
entire household killed and you know

1631
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,410
putting his pyramid yeah

1632
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,819
karakurt's wasn't in the basement it's a

1633
01:03:10,819 --> 01:03:12,290
little bit less glamorous than the

1634
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,569
pyramids of the he of the flowers I

1635
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:15,799
can't remember I think you were at that

1636
01:03:15,799 --> 01:03:18,349
conference the singularity summit was

1637
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:20,690
meeting in New York City yes this was

1638
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,760
right at the time of the Occupy Wall

1639
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,520
Street I forget what year that was

1640
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,910
and maybe 2009 or so in Ray Kurzweil he

1641
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,980
gave his I have a dream speech you know

1642
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,200
and I mean kind of reminded me of being

1643
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,329
in church again like you know we are the

1644
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:37,940
generation that are were the chosen ones

1645
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,290
we're the were the ones that are gonna

1646
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:43,040
make it rapture the rapture for nerds

1647
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,010
yeah and then after he spoke somebody

1648
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,869
else had a bunch of these little BOTS

1649
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,609
that were supposed to be all coordinated

1650
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:52,640
is like a hive mind on the stage and

1651
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,349
they were gonna run around and do

1652
01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:56,869
something but they couldn't get it to

1653
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,700
work because somebody had something on

1654
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,770
in the room that was interfering with

1655
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,859
the you know with the the system that

1656
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:05,630
they were using and I thought well we're

1657
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,030
not even close to having these little

1658
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,660
robots working much some of the working

1659
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,490
issues with heaven and I did there's

1660
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,069
always going to be some issues with bad

1661
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:20,000
words in heaven yeah I mean so I mean

1662
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,560
this is just opens up just

1663
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,690
the ideas I mean if you live forever I

1664
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,630
mean what would that even mean in some

1665
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,510
other the assumption everybody makes I

1666
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,220
think is that your consciousness

1667
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,440
continues even if your physical body

1668
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,650
dies either in a soul or a copy of your

1669
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,720
connectome in on some other platform

1670
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,760
that continues we still picture

1671
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,680
ourselves waking up in this other place

1672
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,740
after the death of our body so it's it's

1673
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,110
sort of a natural born dualism as Paul

1674
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,460
bloom calls it you know we just have

1675
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:53,300
this brain wired up to think that you

1676
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,710
know there's something other than the

1677
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,350
material stuff there is a mind as well

1678
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:59,030
as a brain there's a soul as well as a

1679
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,830
body and so on and it's almost

1680
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,750
impossible to not imagine that in the

1681
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,790
sense that if I say imagine being dead

1682
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,190
you can't do it because to imagine

1683
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,020
something you have to be alive so in a

1684
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,300
way all this has to do with the fact

1685
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,370
that we just can't imagine something

1686
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,440
just epistemologically I don't know what

1687
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,100
it means to not be alive well it's

1688
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,930
interesting because people never think

1689
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,610
about where they were before they were

1690
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,770
born right but you know obsessed about

1691
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,300
what happens after this but where were

1692
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,920
they before they were born this is the

1693
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,540
only boat that were they already in

1694
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,670
heaven before and then they just got

1695
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:34,100
downloaded onto this particular planet

1696
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,410
that's right oh their life and then they

1697
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,960
gonna go up again and of course it's

1698
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,970
terrifying right - most of us you know

1699
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,590
it is terrifying

1700
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,420
you know the idea of seas of not

1701
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,490
existing anymore is it you know I was

1702
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,680
writing one of my chapters I dealt with

1703
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,450
this terror management theory it's

1704
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,400
called yeah based on the idea that

1705
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,840
humans are the only species that know

1706
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,040
we're gonna die and therefore we're

1707
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,960
terrified by this and this motivates us

1708
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,880
to be creative and build pyramids and

1709
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,520
write music and and win Nobel prizes or

1710
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,000
whatever

1711
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,470
I think there's better explanations for

1712
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,820
why people do that that have to do with

1713
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,680
sexual selection theory and trying to

1714
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,370
impress potential mates but that's a

1715
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,980
different discussion but the but you

1716
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,870
know again this idea that people are

1717
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,330
terrorized by death I don't think so I

1718
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,740
think most of the time we're not walking

1719
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,380
around thinking oh my god I'm gonna die

1720
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,940
maybe if you're 90 or something or you

1721
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,490
have a a terminal illness but you know

1722
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,140
most of the time I doubt that you think

1723
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,330
about it well that's probably because

1724
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,220
we're very good suppression techniques

1725
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,310
right so it's an interesting question

1726
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,150
when we

1727
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,340
in evolution did we first have this

1728
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,590
inside we were gonna die we were one day

1729
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,960
not gonna exist anymore is it is that

1730
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,820
neon assaulted me enough L know this

1731
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,670
right is that the origin of religion why

1732
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,320
did people when they first realized

1733
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,150
hominoids that they were gonna die that

1734
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,370
one is that one religion I think some

1735
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,710
people are truly terrified I know and

1736
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,780
not some of my acquaintances who you

1737
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,760
know who are now constantly talking

1738
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,060
about death obsessively really yeah most

1739
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,100
of us I agree I'm not terrified by it if

1740
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,930
I think deeply about it it's scary it's

1741
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,490
no question it's scary right if you

1742
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,500
really think about not being anymore

1743
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,450
forever never ever it's certainly scary

1744
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,220
but most of the time I don't think about

1745
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,280
it yeah I don't believe in this terror

1746
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,250
management theory yeah but people in

1747
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,960
general particularly this culture where

1748
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,580
we've removed death you know we don't

1749
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,590
talk about death there's private dese's

1750
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,900
takes place in the confine of a hospital

1751
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,730
it's not part of our public life anymore

1752
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:31,010
most people are suddenly uncomfortable

1753
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,140
talking about it yeah think about it

1754
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,760
yeah or be reminded of their own

1755
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,500
mortality it's not polite

1756
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,580
yeah right yeah no well so I've looked

1757
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,410
into that in in my chapter on you know

1758
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,360
what what who's the first to realize

1759
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,980
this of course we don't know they these

1760
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,960
things don't fossilize but there are

1761
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,420
those grave sites Neanderthals and early

1762
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,330
Homo sapiens with flowers and the in the

1763
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,490
bodies are arranged and like a prenatal

1764
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,410
condition where they're sort of you know

1765
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,180
buried like almost like they're in the

1766
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,610
womb again with some flowers and grave

1767
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,530
Goods and so on the assumption is that

1768
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,090
they're thinking well this guy's going

1769
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,430
to continue on in some other state and

1770
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,690
we're sending them off with some Goods

1771
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,600
no grave Goods that kind of thing of

1772
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,130
course we don't know I mean it's it's

1773
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,890
like these you know werner herzog made

1774
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:20,380
that beautiful film about cave art the

1775
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,360
the dog what is it called they that cave

1776
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,600
of these dolphin yeah now what was that

1777
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,850
we looked that up I mean it's it's a

1778
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,740
phenomenal film but you know you

1779
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,870
basically we're looking at these images

1780
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,940
that are 30 40 thousand years old and

1781
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,740
thinking well if I did that what would I

1782
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,680
be thinking you know that's just so

1783
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,320
projection that's yeah but you know in

1784
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,810
terms of biology we did I mean yes

1785
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,490
there's still a evolution going on today

1786
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,330
but our basic cognitive operate

1787
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,220
both already fully developed 30,000

1788
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,070
years ago Cave of Forgotten Dreams yes

1789
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:59,640
yeah that's yeah they said yeah that's

1790
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,230
right you can do that accent I can't do

1791
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:03,900
that accent let's talk about altering

1792
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,670
your states of mind this is becoming

1793
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,620
more acceptable now doing it you know

1794
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,080
like micro dosing hallucinogens you did

1795
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,850
the you you write about doing the

1796
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,500
floatation tank with your daughter in

1797
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,930
Singapore I guess you did this yeah I

1798
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,420
did this I know back in the 70s when it

1799
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,640
was popular then I haven't done it

1800
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,580
recently but yeah you strip down you're

1801
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,080
in that it's almost like the salt and

1802
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,690
Sultan of the Dead Sea and you float and

1803
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:30,390
and and so I think I was in maybe an

1804
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,160
hour and a half two hours and after at

1805
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,080
some point I remembered not not really

1806
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,570
hallucinating but I can almost see like

1807
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:39,770
stuff was my brain was generating

1808
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,760
stimulation as if it were coming from

1809
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,440
the outside and what did you experience

1810
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,700
well I have cause had the opposite

1811
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,320
experience I had this what Buddhists

1812
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,900
call a pure experience right so the

1813
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,880
question is can you expect can you be

1814
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,440
conscious without being conscious of

1815
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,180
anything

1816
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,680
all right so usually we're always

1817
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,690
conscious of something I'd be conscious

1818
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,970
of an adding headache or the the worry

1819
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,350
that you know you have to deal with a

1820
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,430
tax return or you know their sound a few

1821
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:11,130
way or pain or whatever so the question

1822
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,410
is can you be in the limit conscious or

1823
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,540
not asleep but without being conscious

1824
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:18,360
of anything and so my experience was in

1825
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,400
the isolation tank yes you strip you

1826
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,710
float in there so very quickly you lose

1827
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,210
your bodily feeling where the

1828
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,130
orientation because you're suspended is

1829
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,720
totally dark of course you don't see

1830
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,150
it's soundproof you don't hear then

1831
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:32,610
early on you can still hear your you can

1832
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,740
actually hear your heartbeat right and

1833
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,080
at some point you adapt you adapt to

1834
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,480
that in my case and you know I try to

1835
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,490
quiet my mind you know of course all the

1836
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:43,950
imagery of the residues of what I was

1837
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,530
thinking in my you know that sort of

1838
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,080
comes up you try to avoid thinking about

1839
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,990
that and at some point at least I felt I

1840
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,910
come to this perfect place where I'm

1841
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:56,820
like suspended in nowhere and not

1842
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,760
conscious of anything but I I but I'm

1843
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,260
still somehow there it's it's a limit

1844
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,810
state clearly because what would it mean

1845
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,580
to be conscious without being conscious

1846
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,940
of anything and it's very it's I found

1847
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,890
it very very attacted and of course in

1848
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,480
the Tibetan Buddhist tradition it's one

1849
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,100
of the things that they feel they want

1850
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,980
to attain the in fact aining this in a

1851
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,720
permanent state is sort of one form of

1852
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,060
off as close you can get to to being

1853
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,489
enlightened yeah it takes them 30 years

1854
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,310
to get there you did it in an afternoon

1855
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:28,870
maybe that's a quick way to do it

1856
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,150
it's obviously a quick and it takes this

1857
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,730
artificial aid and and you know I did it

1858
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,290
the second time and it didn't work the

1859
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,880
second time the second time I was

1860
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,590
constantly thinking about being in the

1861
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,350
state I was too obsessed with it oh I

1862
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,660
have to get into the state it's like

1863
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,370
trying to fall asleep by making yourself

1864
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,690
fall asleep by thinking about following

1865
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:50,170
this exactly exactly exactly have you

1866
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:51,190
ever have you ever done any

1867
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,860
hallucinogens or anything like that yep

1868
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,340
psilocybin and it's it's a wonderful

1869
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,060
experience

1870
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,380
right it's an absolutely wonderful

1871
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,400
experience these all these colors and

1872
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,890
and they're sort of more real than real

1873
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:10,180
and and you know it's feeling some of

1874
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,010
this ego loss so it's a little bit like

1875
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,260
that and of course that's DMT right the

1876
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,090
claim with DMT is and you know the

1877
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:18,160
spirit molecule dimethyl ethylene that

1878
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,080
you can also go into this black hole

1879
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,120
state where you're conscious but you

1880
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,030
lose consciousness of space of time

1881
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,950
you totally lose consciousness of ego

1882
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,710
you know this ego dissolution it's very

1883
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:32,320
powerful but only short acting so that

1884
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,300
may be another way to obtain this the

1885
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,040
state of being conscious without being

1886
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,900
conscious of anything and again the

1887
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,410
theory says so the brain that's minimal

1888
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,720
active will be conscious but without

1889
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,370
being conscious of any one specific

1890
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,830
content so it's not about function here

1891
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,260
I was you know in a in a tank I was

1892
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,910
fully conscious yet I was my brain

1893
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,440
wasn't computing anything it wasn't

1894
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,690
planning it wasn't speaking it wasn't

1895
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,000
imagining it was just in a state of

1896
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,710
being is that like the global work space

1897
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,460
theory hurry no no it's very different

1898
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,170
to a global work space so that's the

1899
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,970
other competing theory was integrated

1900
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,710
that competes was integrated information

1901
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,840
theory in the man in the market space of

1902
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,070
ideas say

1903
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:17,320
that I'm conscious of a specific thing

1904
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,869
like now I'm conscious of the this

1905
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:21,760
question you just asked me so I have to

1906
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,250
keep that active and I put that onto

1907
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,290
this blackboard this is the metaphor

1908
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,150
they use a black box architecture it's

1909
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,889
going to be put in by them workspace and

1910
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:31,810
then it's broadcast to the rest of the

1911
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,610
brain so now it's all about answering

1912
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,040
this question and then it's podcast am I

1913
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,020
talking to my speaking module to my

1914
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,020
planning module to my working memory

1915
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,389
module and in the act of broadcasting

1916
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:45,130
this is what gives rise to consciousness

1917
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,099
sort of the act of broadcasting all this

1918
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:50,440
information different kinds of my brain

1919
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,110
that's what the theory says ultimately

1920
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,030
it's it's about this function of

1921
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,679
broadcasting which is very different

1922
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:58,960
from from integrated information theory

1923
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,909
although some of its newer prediction

1924
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:02,949
may be similar but what I'm asking is is

1925
01:14:02,949 --> 01:14:05,590
is taking a trip like that does that

1926
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,780
give us some information that supports

1927
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,460
one theory of consciousness versus

1928
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,520
another or is it yeah it speaks towards

1929
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,500
more I integrated information theory

1930
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,329
because global work space you have to

1931
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:19,060
have a Content so per definition if

1932
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,920
there isn't any content to broadcast you

1933
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,829
wouldn't be conscious yeah would you do

1934
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:26,710
it again why am i you would oh why don't

1935
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,869
you do it every day or every week or

1936
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:31,329
whatever yeah I know no it's a very good

1937
01:14:31,329 --> 01:14:33,159
question it's a very good question life

1938
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:34,960
is busy and you know you have to if

1939
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,389
you're too stressed it doesn't work mmm

1940
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,489
it's an excellent question Michael why

1941
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:42,040
do this every day I should actually well

1942
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,800
so I mean my listeners is podcasters

1943
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,780
gonna get sick of me telling the story

1944
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,820
but I you know after being on Joe

1945
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,280
Rogan's podcast with Graham Hancock this

1946
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,110
is the alternative archaeology guy that

1947
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,420
writes about places like gobekli tepe

1948
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,400
which is something like a spiritual

1949
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,349
center that's about eleven twelve

1950
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:01,360
thousand years old much older than any

1951
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,940
other monumental architecture so it's a

1952
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,949
bit of an archeological anomaly I have

1953
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:09,070
to admit but he as a separate part of

1954
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,670
his his career he does a lot of

1955
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:15,130
ayahuasca and you know DMT this thing

1956
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,190
and he believes as do apparently most

1957
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,349
people who do this do the ayahuasca a

1958
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,909
trip and they've invited me to come try

1959
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:23,320
this I've never done anything like this

1960
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,230
that that they think it represents a

1961
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,200
place that you actually go to that

1962
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,520
you know opening the doors of perception

1963
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,000
you know the arguments did you feel like

1964
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,450
this is a different reality that exists

1965
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,550
in some way or this is just my brain on

1966
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,990
loose imagens well look I did

1967
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,490
experientially I mean experientially

1968
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,980
it's as real as anything else right but

1969
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,470
I know because you know we study this in

1970
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,600
in people we can study then animals it

1971
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,460
has lawful relationship to the brain I

1972
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,620
can partially induce it you know using

1973
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,690
other physical methods so I know it's

1974
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:59,640
something that the brain generates it

1975
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,200
does feel real it's no question it

1976
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,270
wasn't like oh this is all fake you know

1977
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,770
like if you have you know if you take

1978
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:07,440
follow-up psilocybin or LSD that it

1979
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,880
doesn't feel oh this is fake no it's

1980
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,440
real because it's the only real to your

1981
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,210
app it's reality your brain generates

1982
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,490
but then you learn it's very lawful it

1983
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:17,100
as a lawful a relationship with doses

1984
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,750
you know with particular parts of the

1985
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,790
brain that are active the same parts of

1986
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:22,470
the brain are gonna be active in you and

1987
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,720
me etc so you know it has all these

1988
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,090
lawful relationship and so we realize

1989
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,070
it's kind of your brain your brain

1990
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,630
generates in it's not that you're

1991
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,160
physically traveling is just like I

1992
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,470
don't believe when I dream I'm back you

1993
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,390
know in honor on a climb that I'm

1994
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,190
actually transported to your mouth no

1995
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,500
I'm still lying in my bed my brain is

1996
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,860
generating this dream mm-hmm but why

1997
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,960
would the molecular locking key

1998
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,240
mechanism even exist in the first place

1999
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,330
why is it there oh because you know why

2000
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,700
why is mine why do most of us appreciate

2001
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,390
music

2002
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,400
right it's a evolutionary span though

2003
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,170
why do some people are why are some of

2004
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:00,510
us very good at math did you know what

2005
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,550
is really necessary for kommandantur

2006
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:05,640
Homo sapiens to survive over and to out

2007
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,430
do you know nyan Asano's it's an

2008
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,860
evolutionary span all that happens to be

2009
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,080
that happens to be useful for certain

2010
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,460
things or maybe not even useful

2011
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,430
pleasurable like alcohol you know you I

2012
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:20,160
appreciate a Pinot Noir do I believe

2013
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,540
that there's a specific evolutionary

2014
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,050
reason for me to up to like Pinot Noir

2015
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,790
no it's it's a side effect it's

2016
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:28,620
something we discovered by experimenting

2017
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,360
with lots of different drugs and we find

2018
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,280
there's this one that gives that gives

2019
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,140
rise to pleasurable social interaction

2020
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,060
when you drink it none of the near-death

2021
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,469
experience people argue that these

2022
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:42,420
naturally occurring chemicals in the

2023
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,090
brain are there for when you face death

2024
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,680
when you are there at the at the edge of

2025
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,420
helping you transition from here to

2026
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,340
there wherever there is doesn't matter

2027
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,530
if there's nothing there after death but

2028
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:59,280
that it reduces anxiety about dying it

2029
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,860
quells the uncertainty of it because

2030
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:04,980
it's a real warm good experience that

2031
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,660
people have this is one argument anyway

2032
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,910
so that it's an adit it's an adaptation

2033
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:11,880
estar Gyun yeah and I think that's - I

2034
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,230
mean there well I shouldn't use

2035
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,250
miraculous in this context but the

2036
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,510
wonderful thing about near-death

2037
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:21,060
experiences is that you can also have

2038
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,770
them if you're not religiously inclined

2039
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:25,920
and yes it it massively reduces the

2040
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,230
anxiety that people have you know facing

2041
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,180
death or near death and we don't really

2042
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,460
understand the mechanisms you know why

2043
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,199
that should be if we could somehow

2044
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:36,660
understand them and then distill I'm

2045
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,750
into some therapeutics and we can give

2046
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,790
that to people you know when they get

2047
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,500
into those states and when they are very

2048
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,350
often agitated or very very afraid or

2049
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:49,489
anxious yeah so it's a very interesting

2050
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:52,020
phenomena that the dying brain

2051
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,910
particularly the anoxic brain the brain

2052
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:56,550
when it's cut off an oxygen some subset

2053
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:59,670
a small subset of people you know 10

2054
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:03,199
percent 12 percent can experience yeah

2055
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:06,300
yeah the experience is real the question

2056
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,920
is what does it represent something out

2057
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,739
there in the world are inside the head I

2058
01:19:09,739 --> 01:19:12,930
think the experience yeah yeah you can't

2059
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:14,580
argue with the experience experiences

2060
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,020
early it's as real as any other

2061
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,940
experience but again it seems to have a

2062
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,770
lawful relationship to the underlying

2063
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:25,110
brain matter yeah so what do you what is

2064
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,230
your team working on in the future well

2065
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,420
so with respect to consciousness you

2066
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,520
know we're trying to a further push this

2067
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,170
project where what are the neural

2068
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,960
correlates of consciousness you know in

2069
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,790
which part of the brain in both brains

2070
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:41,820
of animals and in in brains of patients

2071
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,739
and people and then we know this really

2072
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:45,600
interesting collaboration called an

2073
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,350
adversarial collaboration where we get

2074
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,239
together with these people who have a

2075
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,949
very different attitude to consciousness

2076
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:54,030
the people

2077
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:57,390
the of the global workspace where we

2078
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,850
agree upon a common set of experiments

2079
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,580
and where we agree ahead of time and get

2080
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,770
this man is Capri submitted we're gonna

2081
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,050
do this experiment we're gonna exactly

2082
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,670
specify ahead of time what this

2083
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,220
experiment is when it comes out in this

2084
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,260
way it'll support your theory if it

2085
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,330
comes out in that way it'll support our

2086
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,130
theory it's called an adversarial

2087
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,500
collaboration so it's really a new thing

2088
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,050
in the sociology of science and we'll

2089
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,880
see how that works out Congress should

2090
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:29,370
do this well I mean it really in a way

2091
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:30,630
we want to solve the homelessness

2092
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,490
problem or the immigration problem or

2093
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,550
whatever yes it would be great it would

2094
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:37,230
be great if that were to happen same

2095
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,400
thing with science we're all trying to

2096
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,230
understand consciousness we're very

2097
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,210
different takes to it so let's agree on

2098
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:44,160
some experiment that could actually help

2099
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,380
distinguish you know my theory from your

2100
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:52,980
theory yeah I've I have a little excerpt

2101
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,990
here from Steve Pinker's last book

2102
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,810
enlightenment now about his opinion on

2103
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,340
the hard problem of consciousness and

2104
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,380
then I just get your reaction to this in

2105
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,700
the end I still think that the hard

2106
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,340
problem is a meaningful conceptual

2107
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,170
problem but agree with tenet that it is

2108
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:10,020
not a meaningful scientific problem no

2109
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,220
one will ever get a grant to study

2110
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,260
whether you are a zombie or whether the

2111
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,000
same Captain Kirk walks on the deck of

2112
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,370
the enterprise and the surface of Zack

2113
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,920
Dorn and I agree with several other

2114
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,540
philosophers and it may be futile to

2115
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,190
hope for a solution at all precisely

2116
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,620
because it is a conceptual problem or

2117
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,510
more accurately a problem with our

2118
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:30,030
concepts and he discusses a little bit

2119
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,710
of Nagle's what it's like to be a bad

2120
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,200
and and Colin begins running away with

2121
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,180
that he says our best science tells us

2122
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,860
that consciousness consists of a global

2123
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,480
work space well you won't like this part

2124
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,400
representing our current goals memories

2125
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,170
and surround but even if that's wrong he

2126
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,300
says the last dollop in the theory that

2127
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,460
it subjectively feels like something to

2128
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,740
be such a circuitry may have to be

2129
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:52,050
stipulated as a fact about reality where

2130
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:56,400
explanation stops in in other words we

2131
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,970
may we've hit an epistemological wall

2132
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:01,350
you know our friend Deepak Chopra he

2133
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,310
that's what he says you know

2134
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,780
consciousness is the ground of all being

2135
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,630
it is the you know ontological primitive

2136
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,700
there is no explanation for it because

2137
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,630
it just is ok so that may be right

2138
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,520
there's no law in the universe that says

2139
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,440
everything will have a rational you know

2140
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,230
reducible empirical testable explanation

2141
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,580
just like quantum mechanics why does

2142
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,800
quantum mechanics hold right we don't

2143
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,120
know and people have thought about this

2144
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,070
physicists why are we living in the

2145
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,810
universe economy can you seem to be the

2146
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,450
best explanation some people say it's

2147
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,190
just a boat fact we just happen to live

2148
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,690
in one end of discussion

2149
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,880
yeah however we do have to be careful

2150
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,290
you know our imagination is very

2151
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:39,600
powerful what people said before can

2152
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,790
never be solved you know then some neon

2153
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,060
ideas later can be solved and of course

2154
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,430
there is this now you may have seen

2155
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,990
there several books that have now come

2156
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,870
out about what's called pan psychism hmm

2157
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,850
all right so pan site-- is his ancient

2158
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:57,240
belief pan every website he sold that

2159
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,700
everything is in sold that may be

2160
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,660
shredding out they give the guy after

2161
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,160
which the slitting equation of quantum

2162
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,810
mechanics is named you know he thought

2163
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,360
about this that maybe at the hood of

2164
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,580
physics we have to include consciousness

2165
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,250
so this matter and space and time and

2166
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,690
energy but there may also be

2167
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,820
consciousness this is what what ITR that

2168
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,630
what the integrated information

2169
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:18,420
ultimately says and so maybe we have to

2170
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,310
include consciousness in our very

2171
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:23,340
formulation of physicalism so maybe on a

2172
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,800
Death Note and physicalism you know you

2173
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,150
know the modern version of sort of

2174
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:29,460
materialism has to be cast larger and

2175
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,510
has to include subjectivity you know so

2176
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,890
that I think that's a very promising

2177
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,380
development so I'm very skeptical of

2178
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,570
pessimists to tell me oh you shall never

2179
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:41,700
know maybe yes maybe no I know for sure

2180
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,990
if we don't I will not know it's my best

2181
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:47,730
argument for cryonically being

2182
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,350
chronically frozen and coming back five

2183
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,900
hundred years from now and it's like Oh

2184
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,160
consciousness we figured that out 200

2185
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,930
years ago here's the explanation Oh

2186
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,080
obviously

2187
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:02,520
maybe maybe hopefully I just had that

2188
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,500
Donald Hoffman on my podcast that I

2189
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,310
think we released it last week yeah so

2190
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:11,580
he's you know he has this interface

2191
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,220
theory of perception you know that that

2192
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,800
like your your laptop screen here with

2193
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,050
the little trash can down in the corner

2194
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,429
if you open up my macbook

2195
01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:22,709
Pro there's no trash can in there you

2196
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:24,090
know these are just icons that represent

2197
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,909
some process some algorithm that's

2198
01:24:26,909 --> 01:24:28,860
grinding along here and that's what he

2199
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,619
says about you know the reality of you

2200
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:33,449
know this cup is you know there's no cup

2201
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:35,280
in my brain it's just a bunch of neurons

2202
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,429
and this is just an icon that represents

2203
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:39,809
something else

2204
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:41,909
and so on but he's taken that pretty far

2205
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:44,360
not quite the celibate ISM but but that

2206
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,920
there is no possible way to know that

2207
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,249
the true nature of reality yeah I mean

2208
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:52,439
this is an old argument by Immanuel Kant

2209
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:54,179
right if you ever read can't one of the

2210
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:56,039
German idea list you know dusty talks

2211
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:58,079
about dusting and Zee the thing itself

2212
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:00,209
yeah and we have these categories of

2213
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,130
space and time and causality we'll never

2214
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,159
know what reality is really like it goes

2215
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,019
back to our very beginning discussion

2216
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,059
it's ultimately an inference process so

2217
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:10,829
the most likely explanation is that

2218
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:13,229
there is something physical called this

2219
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:15,599
card you know how do I really know what

2220
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:17,070
ultimately I don't know it's an

2221
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,229
assumption I'm gonna go with that

2222
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:21,059
assumption you know and it served as

2223
01:25:21,059 --> 01:25:23,039
well right it served us well making this

2224
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:25,860
assumption allows us to manipulate the

2225
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,420
universe to build you know nuclear

2226
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,789
reactors and cars and and send rockets

2227
01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:31,920
into space so I think it's a reasonable

2228
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,510
assumption would we really know what

2229
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,869
it's ultimately like no we don't yeah

2230
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:38,249
but the fact that we can send a

2231
01:25:38,249 --> 01:25:40,019
spacecraft to Mars and it actually gets

2232
01:25:40,019 --> 01:25:43,289
there and sends information back is a is

2233
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:45,539
a pretty strong argument for there is a

2234
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:47,789
reality yeah and we can know something

2235
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:50,130
about it even if not everything about it

2236
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:54,380
or perfectly represent it yes but yes so

2237
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:57,689
you know it's an old idea yeah it is

2238
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,699
cool I never know but I'm not really

2239
01:25:59,699 --> 01:26:03,630
sure what yeah I mean it's like this

2240
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:06,749
problem I wrote an essay about why is

2241
01:26:06,749 --> 01:26:08,219
there something rather than nothing

2242
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:10,650
Eve even trying to get our minds around

2243
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:13,439
the idea of of nothing is not that

2244
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:14,189
simple

2245
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:18,769
I mean no thing it's a thing that's

2246
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:22,170
there maybe we've hit rock bottom will

2247
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,820
we ever be able to hand somewhere

2248
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,409
there's anything either nothing I don't

2249
01:26:25,409 --> 01:26:27,959
know I I mean I love this quote from

2250
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:31,050
Robert Kuhn he co-authored a book yeah

2251
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:33,239
yeah yeah yeah you know you know

2252
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:34,200
Lawrence cuz you've been

2253
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,180
and always book about the mystery of

2254
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,160
existence yes yes he wrote with John

2255
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:42,900
Leslie yeah so he says you know and talk

2256
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,690
about nothing that not just emptiness

2257
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:48,240
not just blankness and not just

2258
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,180
emptiness and blackness forever but not

2259
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,400
even the existence of emptiness and not

2260
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,620
even the meaning of blackness and no

2261
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,800
forever I mean at some point you know

2262
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,810
we've just hit rock bottom there's the

2263
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,730
words just fall off the page and like I

2264
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,710
have no idea what you're talking about

2265
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:08,130
yes I think this is very likely one of

2266
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:11,310
those cases you know it's I don't know

2267
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,950
how much you've read about the mysterion

2268
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:16,320
mysteries you know the the it could be

2269
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,820
our brains we're just not big enough to

2270
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,400
have the concepts to answer those kinds

2271
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,080
of quitting enough to think of the

2272
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,940
concept and the problem but not answer

2273
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,420
it at least our conversion yes yeah or

2274
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,210
you know Vic and Stein used the words we

2275
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,250
use we don't have the right words to

2276
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,170
have the concepts to even think properly

2277
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,300
about it or not yeah things like that

2278
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,950
yeah so I'm just talking about a little

2279
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,590
bit easier things like called yes that's

2280
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,240
right you have the easy problem the easy

2281
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,980
problem of consciousness well the neural

2282
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,660
correlates I guess sir this suppose it

2283
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:49,560
easy but they're not that easy all right

2284
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,540
so the feeling of life itself this was a

2285
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,860
sequel to your you know romantic

2286
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:57,900
reductionist what are you what what's

2287
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:01,680
next on the on the Christoph agenda for

2288
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,500
big big big questions I don't know I

2289
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,750
mean you know I'm running this large

2290
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:09,600
Institute with Serena plus scientists

2291
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,640
we're very productive so on you know I

2292
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,250
might take a break from from from

2293
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:16,230
writing although you know right now I'm

2294
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,600
several sonic American articles coming

2295
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,550
out on brain death his brain Dias

2296
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,500
irreversible there's some really

2297
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,720
interesting you know science going on

2298
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,290
there so stay tuned they're always

2299
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:29,730
interesting things happening in the

2300
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,320
world of neuroscience and unlike

2301
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,170
cardiology let's say you are your brain

2302
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:36,480
and you know most you know they're all

2303
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,790
these fascinating ideas tied up with

2304
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:40,560
your brain and your identity and where

2305
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,940
do you go at night and where do you go

2306
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,340
after after death and what can we do to

2307
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,590
preserve the brain etc what's the future

2308
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,850
of the Institute now that

2309
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:51,420
Allen's gun so we are not secure you

2310
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,400
know this was you know we we talked

2311
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,820
about with Paul about this many times

2312
01:28:55,820 --> 01:29:00,600
they say estate his sister Jodie Allen

2313
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,490
is in charge of the estate and and we

2314
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,380
are now planning for 25 years

2315
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,990
mmm we wickedly are moving on at 25

2316
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:09,480
years trajectory there was there was

2317
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,030
discussed at great length was with with

2318
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:15,060
Paul Allen so we are here to stay the

2319
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,440
earth and you're there for the duration

2320
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,600
your yeah I mean you're not going back

2321
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,190
to Caltech or being a professor or

2322
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,650
anything like that I don't know I'm not

2323
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:24,750
going back to Caltech well my exactly so

2324
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,970
my presidency you know was for ten years

2325
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,590
so that's that's gonna I'm gonna step

2326
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:30,330
down from that in two years or something

2327
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,880
like that and to return to a more active

2328
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,530
role as scientists I fundamentally I'm a

2329
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,140
scientist I love science and so I may go

2330
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,880
back but remain here at the Institute

2331
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,890
and just do signs and writing full-time

2332
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,840
again because you're mostly doing

2333
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,870
administrative work yeah I mean they're

2334
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:46,860
three no people you have to make

2335
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,570
decision what the fun but not too fun

2336
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,550
you have no hundred employee I have six

2337
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,110
employees and that's five too many I

2338
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:55,910
don't know how you 300 yes it's

2339
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:58,080
sometimes it's challenging and are you

2340
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,530
still mountain climbing no I know here

2341
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,060
because it's much more conducive so I

2342
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,310
don't have a car i I just by Gabby being

2343
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:08,400
a ho you know cool boring it's also much

2344
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,470
more copia to the metaphor being a team

2345
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:13,050
knows you know in a boat was eight and a

2346
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,520
Coxon you're only as good as your

2347
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,230
weakest link and you know no matter

2348
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:17,910
whether people are big or small or of

2349
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,850
you know my or you know have a big frame

2350
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,590
or a small frame you know you have to

2351
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,120
synchronize you have to be a team it's

2352
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,430
not the star performers really the team

2353
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,410
and it's set as a whole that counts and

2354
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:30,930
so it is was our Institute here you're

2355
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:32,430
like a single neuron with all these

2356
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:34,200
other neurons that are somehow coming

2357
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,480
together is a single brain yes so we a

2358
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,790
team so what makes very different from

2359
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:41,250
folks in university we try to only take

2360
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,470
on one or two other things as a team and

2361
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:44,970
to discuss so that has some unique

2362
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:47,540
challenges as any other large you know

2363
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,710
astronomy your elementary particle

2364
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:51,650
physics project yeah yes

2365
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:54,870
yeah and in do you guys work at all on

2366
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,120
brain diseases like Alzheimer's and

2367
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,800
senility and dementia

2368
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,280
we will we're starting to think about

2369
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,080
that so most of what we do is still

2370
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,510
basic signs by trying to get the basic

2371
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,250
layout on particular of the human brain

2372
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:11,620
but assets become very successful we're

2373
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,690
now moving into developing viral

2374
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:16,660
technology for the human brain so in

2375
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,550
other words once we know there's some

2376
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,860
specific defect of a specific gene

2377
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,630
that's missing in a particular type of

2378
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:25,270
cell can we then devise technologies

2379
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:27,940
like viral technologies to deliver that

2380
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:30,940
missing gene to those right neurons in

2381
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:33,100
order to cure people yeah so we're

2382
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,290
starting to think about disease

2383
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:38,110
applications yeah you guys got to solve

2384
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:39,610
this problem before you and I hit the

2385
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:42,790
wall because you know these people like

2386
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:43,990
when I was writing my book you know it's

2387
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:45,190
like Shermer don't you want to live to

2388
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,920
be 500 I'm like look just get me to 90

2389
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,020
without prostate cancer and a hundred

2390
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,110
without Alzheimer's and dementia and now

2391
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:54,850
these are hard problems and you know we

2392
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,550
ask them through our mutual friend

2393
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,530
Deepak I met you know Rudy tanzy from

2394
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,600
Harvard he's you know like the head the

2395
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,640
big Alzheimer's guy and it's like when

2396
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,590
you really bore down on it you know

2397
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:08,350
we're kind of clueless about the causes

2398
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,550
and you know the plaques and tangles

2399
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,050
yeah but what causes the plaques and

2400
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,000
tangles no one knows is you know

2401
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,920
genetics environment you know he has you

2402
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,300
know general stuff you should eat well

2403
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,640
and exercise and sleep yes yes yes I

2404
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,620
know I'm doing that but what else and

2405
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:24,190
you know show I do Sudoku puzzles you

2406
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:25,510
know there's not much I think you'll

2407
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:28,330
find I think you'll be fine just just be

2408
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,760
very active yeah I mean but the brain is

2409
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,590
by far the most complex system it's

2410
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,900
vastly more complicated than any system

2411
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,240
physicists have tackled with and it

2412
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,700
might well be a while before you know we

2413
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,890
fully understand these diseases and can

2414
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,680
cure them yeah we just have to keep

2415
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,710
trying oh it's Michael yeah I know it's

2416
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,080
a pressing on your time now the book is

2417
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,700
the feeling of life itself we will

2418
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,260
release this on the day it comes out in

2419
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:56,370
September whatever that date is and

2420
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,270
congratulations on another good book

2421
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:00,040
thank you much that was a great

2422
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,350
conversation you are fantastic question

2423
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,720
you always leave deep background I don't

2424
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,090
know I'm kind of a dummy I just ask good

2425
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:08,260
questions because I don't really know

2426
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,140
I'm just curious you know along

2427
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,030
okay I will see you next time I'm in

2428
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,540
Seattle or next time you're right

2429
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:19,500
yep all right
