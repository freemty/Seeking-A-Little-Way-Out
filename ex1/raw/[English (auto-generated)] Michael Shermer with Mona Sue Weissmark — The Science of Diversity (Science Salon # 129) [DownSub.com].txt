so with that i'll introduce my next

guest

my guest this week is mona sue weismark

and to discuss her new book the science

of diversity

mona is an american clinical

psychologist and social psychologist

researcher and author

whose work on diversity and justice has

received global recognition

she's best known for her ground-breaking

social experiment of bringing children

of holocaust survivors

face to face with children of nazis and

later

grandchildren and great-grandchildren of

african-american slaves with descendants

of slave owners

she's also a professor of psychology and

author of numerous journal articles and

books including

doing psychotherapy effectively justice

matters legacy of the holocaust in world

war ii

and the new book that we're discussing

from oxford university press

the science of diversity this was a most

interesting conversation because we're

recording this right in the middle of

2020 and so i wanted to talk to her

about

black lives matter the metoo movement

reparations

uh the response to covet 19 and income

inequality and the

sense of injustices that a lot of people

feel

uh going on in society now and this is

what she does

uh so we got into some really

interesting

discussions about all of that plus the

nature of the self and free will

and what is justice and uh you know how

to

um bring about restorative justice

across multiple

generations and because this

conversation

we're having now on reparations for

example and

um and in the black lives matter

movement i think this is not going to

just fade away

when things return to relative normalcy

in society i think this is going to

continue

so i wanted to get her opinions on all

these and uh and she gave them to me

very thoughtfully

so with that i give you mona sue

weisbach mona thanks for coming on the

show

thank you very much as we can see over

your right shoulder is the science of

diversity okay i read it all but maybe

the last 10 pages i didn't quite get to

that

and um i have to say this was um

it was really kind of a mind blower i

think it's a super important book

for a couple reasons but in in part

if uh if we had to re-title your book i

i'd almost call it if this wasn't

already taken how to be an anti-racist

uh or anti-misogynist or anti-bigot or

whatever

because the science of diversity shows

you that we really can't

stereotype and prejudge people based on

these collective

categories we put people in which is all

good

but the problem is is that you're a

scientist and

your program here is in a way i think

challenged if not undermine the

scientific enterprise in which we want

to find

collective laws that explain old

actions of you know human action based

on generalization so he might say

something like

the number one predictor of violence is

maleness or something like that

and uh and what you've showed is that

it really comes down to so many

individual differences that

it's really really hard to tell

determine causality in in human action

so i i thought you know in this

conversation i want to start there

the science of how we understand human

action

and then move in the direction toward

understanding

the black lives matter movement the

metoo movement

of the movement of nationalism and you

know ethnonationalism and

and all that populism we're going

through since 2016 because

um and now you know reparations are back

on the table as a conversation these are

hugely important

issues um that are on the table for 2020

and probably in the

next several years and and you're a

scientist addressing these what are

really policy issues so

i think um you know every everyone in

congress should read your book before

they vote on

on these kinds of things because uh the

science behind it really matters

so let's start there what what got you

into uh studying the science of

diversity

um well you said so many things right

before that question but we're going to

get into that so

i'll just focus um

would you like me to

well i'll answer two questions one uh

you brought up the difference between

applying scientific thinking to

what i would call deterministic systems

where you can predict

and use statistics to to make

predictions which of course you can in

many

cases it's how the insurance business

stays in business

i look very much at dynamic system

and interactions so it's people studying

people

and then unpredictable things happen in

those situations so

therefore i'm not so as

as interested in predicting as i am

and looking at topics that people bring

to the table that are polarizing and how

can we study that

um what led me to that was your question

what led me to that or what the

motivation is about your background your

background is really interesting as a

child uh survivor or a survivor of the

holocaust

and that led you into trying to

understand what it's like to be a nazi

and what it's like to be a victim of a

nazi

uh and the psychology of that i mean

that's really hugely interesting and

important

and drove so much of psychological

research in the 60s and 70s

and so i think as far as i could tell

that kind of moved you personally into

understanding

human behavior

um you know and that actually brings me

that ties into what we talked

with what we just mentioned the

unpredictability right so

i kind of distinguish between signs with

an upper

s as a noun and scientific thinking and

i know you talk a lot about that too

michael in your lectures

and so when you're using scientific

thinking you're also

beginning with a guess why

is that hypothesis how did i get to that

hypothesis so

absolutely yeah my personal ground is

what led me

with some research looking at children

of survivors for example

and children of descendants of slaves

and how that impacted them

and a few studies on descendants of

nazis and a few on descendants of slave

owners

no one had actually thought about what

will happen if you bring the two groups

together

and and what happens dynamically in

those conversations

how does the past impact them how was

that injustice transmitted

that brings us to black lives matter to

reparations to everything we're seeing

today so

i was motivated to look at that because

in my own personal history

i went through that process i mean i

might add i had the least traumatic

childhood i know of

my parents were very devoted that's

actually important to to mention

um grew up on a farm in finland new

jersey

you know my first friends was a dog and

a chicken

and my only memory of the past we're

seeing the numbers on my parents arm

right and then later on i would inquire

about that

um and so then i began to be curious

what if an injustice cannot be balanced

in the first generation right

then what happens how does that play out

psychologically i'm not talking legally

or economically

so that's what led me to look at the

psychology of injustice and the

diversity of science yeah

um yeah our listeners can can find your

videos of you

getting these survivors together in the

same room it's it's really an incredible

uh thing to witness and and i think if

we just start there with the

survivors of the children of of nazis

and the children of

uh holocaust survivors and i think the

relevance to

the reparations question is that most of

us who are neither

victims or perpetrators or

nth generations thereof feel like

what does this got to do with me why do

i have to pay

for you know past generation sins

and uh you know we shouldn't you know uh

hold the children of the of the

perpetrators accountable

and and so i don't get it uh what what's

that what's the issue here

um so talk for a moment about

um why a let's say child of a nazi guard

at a concentration camp

would feel any guilt he didn't do

anything he wasn't even born yet

or the child of one of the surviving

victims

you know why would they feel whatever it

is they feel

since it didn't happen to them and i

think the the generalization is here for

most of us who in america think like

well

i wasn't a slave holder i wasn't even a

descendant of a slave holder i came here

last week or my parents came here you

know

20 years ago or whatever what does this

got to do with me

and and for the children of former

slaves their

nth generation away now you know why

should they get

uh you know a check every month for this

when it didn't happen to them so

um um so so take it from there what what

what is the psychology or the

neuroscience behind

you know the carrying on of of these

kinds of atrocities

past many generations well i think you

summed up the feelings really well on

both sides

so i think descendants of victims and

whether it's

um holocaust descendants of holocaust

survivors or descendants of slave owners

it's natural to feel psychologically

speaking

not everybody i think that's really

important to mention i don't mean to be

lumping all descendants

there's a lot of variety within the

groups but

a lot of descendants of victims and i

think it's important to say here victims

these are not victims and victimizers

these are the descendants of

there's a need for justice that the

sense that something was done to their

ancestors and that

no one has paid for it and again i mean

psychologically

and so wanting some kind of closure

wanting to hold someone

responsible what we found when we

brought the two groups together both

slave owners and

descendants of slaves and not

descendants of nazis and descendants of

survivors that

well the other side as you so aptly

pointed out

not everyone on the other side feels

responsible for what their

parents or great great grandparents did

in fact at one of our meetings

a descendant of a slave owner said i'm

not sure you could say this today

someone in class the other night asked

me if we did this meeting today what

would be different

and what would be different is i think

with the canceled culture

it would be harder for people to be um

honest and truthful but this was you

know some years ago when the descendant

of a slave owner said you know slavery

was legal then

that's a good example of someone he

didn't mean it in a mean way he was not

an extremist he just said

it was legal and i don't feel um guilty

for it

on the other hand was a descendant of a

slave owner whose parents

are very active right now in ohio and

the kkk

and she did feel very guilty very

responsible so there's a variety

but on the flip side what happens is the

descendants of victims

because they have this need to see

justice psychologically the sense of

balance someone pay

it's very difficult for them to

hear the other side like when you

said when you explain that many

descendant

many people in our country whites do not

feel that they are responsible for what

happened that's very hard

for someone on the descendant of a slave

to hear and i know that i mean

personally and professionally

when i went through my process you want

all the germans

to feel responsible for what their

forefathers did

very fascinating and that is the science

of diversity what i talk about when we

bring these groups

together to study them is and this just

happened in class last night so

if you can have a conversation on these

polarizing topic

and you can this is very difficult to do

but if you can step out and say wow okay

this descendant of a slave owner has

said

slavery was legal and he does not feel

responsible

or this descendant of a nazi just said

you know what i've suffered

because i have been made to feel

responsible for something

that i never did right and in fact we

did a statistical analysis we used lag

sequential analysis to look at the

conversational patterns

and what we found this is not really

that surprising but we actually studied

it

is that each side and these are

descendants

felt in some sense like victims

the so-called descendants of the

victimizers

felt that they have also

been suffering at some level

because they're held responsible for

something that they

don't feel that they did

um

the conversations that are on that video

people can watch if they go to your

webpage

that you reprint in the book some of the

comments i'll just read a few

just to give people an idea of what goes

through

people's heads call it rationalization

or whatever

steve pinker calls it the moralization

gap which he got from roy baumeister's

book

uh called evil in which roy interviewed

the serial killers in prison

and to a man and they're pretty much all

men you know they had they gave

what they thought were perfectly good

reasons for why they did what they did

you know he had it coming he

insulted me in front of my girlfriend or

he he you know or she cheated on me so i

killed her whatever you know they had

what in their heads were

you know this is why i did it i'm not an

evil person

this was an act that you know had to be

done for moral reasons

in other words there's kind of a

moralization behind these

crimes but those are the actual victims

and victimizers you're talking about

here i'm talking about the not the

defendant

that's right the actual that's right

yeah yeah

um well that's actually i no i want to

pause there

because that's very very different and

so i can see where you would use

like a rationalization or moralization

but these are

i'm talking about descendants who had no

right part

in any act and so i would

not use the word moralization or

justification

i not at all because they they didn't

not commit an

act that's what makes the topic

polarizing

right because they each have even though

i

i mean you know people will even though

it's hard right i mean i would say

personally that my mother suffered more

than anyone right she lost

all her family and my father and when a

descendant

not a nazi a descendant of a nazi said

to me

but you know what we suffered too our

cities were bombed

my parents were forced from my viewpoint

i've suffered more

my parents suffered more but from their

viewpoint that's why i would not call it

moralization or justification

their view is they suffer too and

i cannot

deny their viewpoint um if i want to

have a conversation if i want to

pose on them my view that i suffered

more we're

probably not going to get very far in

the conversation

that's what the signs of diversity

method tries to do

tries to look at these polarizing topics

without these

per um without

in advance judging the other person's

viewpoint that's sort of a but i want to

emphasize that's not true for the first

generation obviously if you've committed

a crime you've committed a crime

i'm talking about descendants and that's

so important

although i do want to talk about the

actual victims and

and restitution i mean i saw this

yesterday with there was a news story

about

um the settlement of

um harvey weinstein i think it was like

20 million or 40 million dollars or

something

i guess his insurance companies are

going to pay out to these women

but several of them are on the news last

night saying it's not the money

and it isn't gonna restore the damage

done to me

it helps but you know i need something

more

um you know so that there is still that

kind of gap there between and of course

harvey's sitting there going what did i

do wrong

you know so um just a couple passes yeah

yeah

a couple passages from your book i mean

that's more that's complicated i mean

that's

i agree i don't study that at all

between the victim and victimizers i

don't study right

so i i don't i don't have i don't know

anything about that really

but just back back to your book here

here's a couple of passages that i

thought were

were quite striking another child of a

nazi described it like this

i think the americans and the allies

went too far i think of the bombing of

german cities like dresden was unfair

and i don't think it was right that the

allies tried the nazis it should have

been done

by german courts and the other thing is

uh not all germans were nazis the first

people killed in dachau were german

people not jewish people

i think the jews want to make it seem

like they were the only victims but

they're not the german people suffered

too and people need to know it

but germans are afraid to talk about it

well everything that guy said is

is true i mean you know we we did bomb

dresden in hamburg

and there was moral there were moral

debates about whether we should commit

mass bombing at the beginning of the war

when the germans

did it to the british in the in the

blitz uh the feeling was like that's an

immoral act that's like chemical warfare

we just don't do that that's out of

bounds and

you know within two years we were doing

it um and

you know so he's he's right in that

sense

i don't know how you counter that other

than what you just said you don't

counter it you just acknowledge yes

that's true and then

because you don't want to get into i

guess a victimhood olympics or something

like who had the most suffering

and that's actually the really key point

michael because it's very

very difficult so when people say oh

just be rational

um and have a rational discussion about

this

so i would say if that's not always

possible because there are strong

feelings on this right so why can't you

acknowledge the other side

right what makes it difficult to hear a

german say that

well the other side feels like their

family suffered so much and that is

disrespectful you see that today with

descendants of slaves if the descendant

of slave owner says it's

legal i suffer too you know

we lost a lot of um

um economic i mean we lost a lot

during the civil war what have you it's

very hard for the

the other side to hear that and it's not

easy so the thing is using the the

science of diversity method in these

conversations which i think

we're not used to our educational system

doesn't train us to do this i mean i

know you know this

but we don't have these conversations on

who's right

on who's wrong that's not the purpose of

the conversation

the purpose of the conversation is to

keep it moving

and to see if you can understand your

own

strong feelings about it and not

necessarily change your mind but hear

the other side

and that is not easy very very difficult

i recall it took several days of long

days of conversations for you to make

much

progress on that front correct but i

mean even

this is happening in my classes i've

been teaching this for 20 years

just had a class last night and it was

very fascinating the students had to do

they're doing a project a measuring

identity people's

um ethnic identity and so we had them in

breakout groups and there happened to be

an african-american student

uh talking to a white student and they

were talking about

um their identities giving each other

the measure

and she had an insight in it where she

felt very much like you know i've

suffered because i have a history of

slavery i don't even know

my background very well where my african

roots are but i'm proud

of it because i know they survived and

she was very surprised in this meeting

to discover that the descent that this

uh white person

was ashamed of being white

never occurred to her and then she began

to wonder did anything

anything in her behavior impact

the person to feel that way so there's a

recognition

in this process of the other person's

um views and how they might contribute

to it so i'll give you one other example

that was in the descendant of slaves

i mean nazi survivor there was a

descendant of

a um high-ranking nazi whose family

was whose father was responsible for the

murders of many many jews

and then she said that she grew up

really guilty

felt terrible and afraid and it was the

first time descendants of

uh survivors thought wow i didn't

realize she was suffering and they kind

of reached out

about that but that's a process right

that's part of that restorative

justice movement that's underway now i

wrote about this in the moral arc that

you know that somebody who just burgles

your house you know they

they don't want to hurt you they just

want your stuff because whatever their

motive is

but of course for the victim this is

incredibly disruptive i mean it just

like ruins their lives for months or

years

and you know they can't sleep at night

and they're anxious and so on and and to

the burglar it's like this was nothing

so uh you know i read a few accounts of

these where

you know they would get them in the same

room together and uh

and usually the burglar said gee i had

no idea it was so disruptive you know i

just wanted

if you i just wanted your tv set or

whatever and uh

and that kind of acknowledgement of uh

you know i really ruined your life made

the victim feel better

and uh but what i am suggesting michael

is that in the next generation

down if you want to have a conversation

again these are not people who did

anything to each other

they're innocent they're both innocent

and if you begin with a restorative

justice in mind

that the other side has to apologize

or make amends or um give you

reparations

that will end the conversation that will

not restore justice because you're

actually imposing

a model on it and these are descendants

and both sides

do not have not perpetuated any kind of

crime on the other

so to really have this dynamic

conversation you cannot begin

with expecting an acknowledgement or an

apology

right because that will end the

conversation because many of the other

descendants don't feel they have to

apologize

or acknowledge you know so that makes it

more difficult in a sense

what do you think about these truth and

reconciliation uh

movements in different nations where the

nation apologizes like

australia apologized to the indigenous

peoples and canada apologized to the

first peoples and

those sorts of things is that at least a

good good start

yeah i think that my opinion is not

really so important because

you know i i what their reasons are

whether they were political reasons

or whether they had other reasons i

don't know

my take on it would be psychologically

uh in in groups i can't really comment

on that i'm i'm familiar with that

because when we started this

these meetings in the 90s people kind of

took some of the research i was doing

and said oh but now we need to ask

you know we can do this at the

nationwide but the goal is different so

if we're just

trying to study this

and understand this and apply the

science of diversity method

you can't i would say you're imposing

a model and expecting people to

apologize paradoxically

may create a bigger problem and that's

what we're seeing in the united states

today there are many people

who resent having to apologize

and i'm not saying personally whether i

agree or disagree i'm just saying those

opinions are out there whether we like

it or not

in fact recent pew data showed

that for example supportive black lives

matter if you look at blacks and whites

71 of black strongly support it

and it was not 31 percent of whites

support it

big gap between democrats and

republicans

62 of democrats 7 republicans this isn't

surprising

there's a huge polarization but if we're

coming forth and saying oh you have to

apologize for slavery

no matter how convinced i personally may

be of that or you or anyone else

the fact is there's going to be a whole

other group of people who have a

completely different view

so if our goal is to move forward in a

conversation

we have to consider that our view is not

acceptable

to other people right well

okay so where do you go from there i

mean here last week last sunday's new

york times

magazine cover story is you know the

case for reparations

that wasn't the title i think it was

what we are owed

right and um her case was not moral so

much as economic

you know and it sort of forces those of

us that don't think about these things

uh though that is us you know sort of

middle-aged middle-class white guys that

you know haven't been affected by this

uh directly or even indirectly

you know while i really hadn't thought

about the trajectory of economic

inequality over the last

century and a half and you know how that

results in different school systems and

educational

outcomes and therefore different incomes

and

wealth disparities and that sort of

thing so there she seems to be taking

not a moral

case or even a psychological one but

just more of a kind of an economic

calculation

that yeah and again i don't address

economic or political

i'm not an expert in political or

economic but i can tell you

pretty confidently that there will be a

lot of people

who will resent any kind of economic

reparations and furthermore there'll be

a lot of

other groups of people who say wait a

second he's had advantages

i've been left behind so

though that person may feel strongly

about the economic

uh impact of slavery and how that's

affecting

and income inequality today there are

many people who disagree

right okay how do we get past that

impasse then

because that's probably not going to

change anytime soon

no correct well one way to get past the

impasse is

to the notion that you can impose and

control and demand what other people

should be thinking they're accepting

from a you know psychological viewpoint

there's the notion that yeah it's nice

to feel right

but it's entirely possible that what

you're

thinking and feeling is wrong from the

other viewpoint you have to consider

the other viewpoint but furthermore

practically pragmatically if you impose

something it may have a backlash and

though you're trying to solve one

problem the solution to the problem is

actually creating a bigger

problem which is resentment and anger

about what's being imposed on so

first you have to begin using this kind

of

scientific thinking not science with an

upper s

scientific thinking to look at both

these viewpoints and to consider both

these viewpoints

and give them their equal due that's the

only fear-sided method we actually have

not talking again legally that's a whole

other issue

politically but as far as i know the

wonderful thing about scientific

thinking it's our only

universal method

globally accepted for advancing

our way of learning so

an understanding and so therefore if you

can teach scientific thinking which i

think i've i've done it i've seen it

firsthand it's not that difficult

on any polarizing topic we're talking

about one

reparations you can talk about for

example

um are the police biased right uh

in terms of uh shootings are they more

likely to shoot a black person suspect

than a white

there's conflicting evidence on that

that we've many people think yes they

are

there's equally good evidence no they're

not

um again i'm not weighing in on this i'm

not saying personally what i think it's

not really relevant what i'm saying is

let's look at the mixed

evidence teaching people how to sort

through

mixed evidence which in the social

sciences is mostly

right well most contradictory findings

read in your book that came to mind that

that the killing of of george floyd

by derek chovan and

you know immediately the mind goes to

you know anecdotal thinking and then

stereotyping

okay i've seen three videos in the last

two weeks of

white cops killing black guys therefore

cops are racist right and but

the science that you describe in the

book really we ca we can't

even in principle make that kind of

generalization

unless it was every one of them um

because what we really want to know is

not

do cops white cops kill black people

it's

why did that guy derek chauvin kill that

guy at that moment

why did that happen correct

but also we want to know so roland fryer

did a great study out of harvard showing

yes the police

sorry showing the police are not biased

great study it's you know it's been

looked at a lot

and um he was very surprised he happens

to be african-american

he was very surprised of course then

cody ross

did another study and he showed the

exact opposite that in fact

white cops are biased right in shooting

so

yes i agree michael i think you're

saying two things

one is the outlier is very interesting

the specific case the dynamics but it's

also interesting to look at the

conflicting evidence

why these two studies and how can people

make sense of this the average citizen

and the analogy i use in class i don't

know if it's a good one but

i like it we you know we expect people

to take a driver's license test so we're

safe on the road

i don't think it's much more difficult

to teach scientific thinking to analyze

conflicting results

so that people can see both viewpoints

and that will uh help them understand

why and and you know people are

polarized

then in that example how would you

square those two different findings

well those two findings are very

interesting they use different data sets

prior

use police reports which some people say

are not reliable

um and ross used open

data source so they had completely

different data so the inputs were

different and they used different

statistical analyses

but this is the case with so

many studies finding conflicting results

i mean take the pandemic should we wear

the mask

some studies say yes some studies say no

so understanding and i wrote an article

about this on psychology today

i don't remember if i actually got into

it in the book called

evaluating psychology research

i think it's really important because

sometimes even personally you need to

make a decision i broke my arm a few

years ago

should i get that thing whatever you put

in it or not

had to look at conflicting studies and

then i had to see am i an outlier

which is really important but these are

all really teachable skills and then you

have an informed

group of citizens who are able to judge

and evaluate and right now i think we've

lost faith because

whether intentionally or not and i

certainly have done this and i can

tell you an example of something i'm not

proud of and how i was blinded by one

view

but then if we're able to do that you're

more likely to see both viewpoints

not as equally true but just different

perspectives

the question of equally true is a really

i think deep question

so um because it gets at the question of

do i mean morally equivalent i've got a

whole lot to say it's it

i don't mean they're necessarily morally

equivalent

but as i just gave you that data we know

that 60

62 percent of democrats think black

lives matter

and seven do not well can we look at

some research to

to find out why they'll always be

conflicting data

so we don't come to it to decide is

ross's study better than friars

the point is is to look at it and to see

what are

why are these two studies different take

implicit bias that's a very important

but there's a lot of yeah let's talk

about that yeah

yeah what do you think of those studies

and they've been challenged now

well i think you wrote a great article

on it are we all racist

which summarizes the major issues um

which but that's what i mean about

applying critical thinking i'm not

trying to judge does it exist or doesn't

exist the point is there's a bunch of

studies that say

measure's not reliable take it today

take it tomorrow you're going to get

different it's like 0.3

other studies say it's also not

predictive you may score as a bias right

but have nothing to do with behavior but

then there's a group of some studies

that say no it is predictive

you did the right thing in your article

you looked at the meta-analysis

which is a way to summarize all of the

studies and then it

kind of tells you something um and then

you

so you have people discuss that so you

don't have people cherry-picking oh you

see it yes

this is the answer no this is not the

answer we're not cherry-picking we're

looking at both

sets yeah findings yeah i think a

meta-analysis is super important

whenever you

encounter one of these cutesy psych

studies like if you keep your desktop

clean you'll

donate more money or if you're at the

top of the escalator you'll donate more

money than at the bottom of the

escalator

you know these things are just too

they're too kitschy

in a way let's wait till there's a

hundred studies and see what comes out

something like that also the convergence

of evidence uh argument i like to use uh

or what william yule called the the

consilience of inductions

we have independent lines of inquiry all

pointing to one

uh particular conclusion or not so

climate change for example

is my favorite example of this or theory

of evolution you know there

there's not one factoid that supports

these theories there's you know

thousands tens of thousands

accumulated from independent lines of

inquiry from

different fields so it's not like the

the climatologist is meeting with the

the geologist and the glaciologist and

the guy that studies clouds whatever

that's called

or the guy that studies ecological

development

of flowering plants that are now

flowering earlier and earlier in the

year because of the temperature

and on and on and on it's not like these

guys are all meeting on the weekends to

get their stories straight for the the

you know the liberal conspiracy against

the right

you know it's that it's that because

they're independent our

confidence that the conclusion that

global warming is real and human cause

goes up

so even though there's uh counter

studies here and there that people can

point to

uh mostly conservatives point to these

uh we can

you know sort of counter that with this

massive

data from either meta-analyses or these

these

kind of convergence of evidence from

these independent lines

the other thing i want to comment about

that i got from your book too is this

um that we were just talking about the

cops there is no

the cops which cops which police i mean

and which encounters because i i read

the staggering numbers recently of

something like 370 million

in interactions between the police and

uh

citizens every year in the united states

so that's over a million a day

and so you know you just do a lar law of

large numbers calculation

if you if you have it maybe 0.001

percent are just psychopathic [ __ ]

that should never have a gun and a badge

and you just multiply that by the 370

million encounters you're gonna get

you know some of these just uh real

outlier

uh incidents is where somebody dies and

and you know from a science of diversity

point of view

i'm asking is there a problem to be

solved other than

that particular guy should have never

been given a badge what can we do to

screen

those types of psychopaths out of the

police department and that sort of thing

and that's really important it's not

only the cops i think

at least my read of news and media and

everything

is everything there's a lot of lumpers

out there so there are the whites

the blacks um and it it's constant

um you know even in

popular books now you know i know the

whites think this i know the blacks

think this i think

or the cops or what have you and

reality and i'm using that

word carefully it shows us that within

any group there's a lot of variety

there's not only differences between

groups there's tremendous differences

in groups gould wrote a brilliant

article on this

i can't remember the title exactly it

had median and

mode and it was why and when it was

applying to his cancer and he was trying

to

yeah but it's it's a very deep article

because

i think it gets to exactly what you're

asking about i mean what you're

referring to which is the importance of

understanding the outlier

the outlier isn't just a freak

right we all are truly unique

so sometimes you want to understand

things on average like if i'm in the

insurance business

but other times if you're talking to

black people or white

people it's more useful to say who is

this

individual person that i'm talking to

now

and that's very different than

addressing the group or the police for

example

well yeah yeah no no that's that's right

yeah so to our listeners that was steve

gould's essay the median is not the

message

so he's given this cancer diagnosis

based on on the median

statistics but he wants to know what

what's the spread

what's the standard deviation could he

be one of the outliers and it turns out

he was

um even though cancer ended up getting

him in the long run

25 years later or something like that

different kind of cancer in that case

but you know when i watched that tape of

derek chauvin killing george floyd

you know it's almost like the eichmann

trial i didn't see a you know

an evil racist guy with hate in his

heart he looked like a cold

killer like like this is just another

day at the office

i mean it was really in a way more

frightening uh because it's like

how would you recognize that it's what

hana rent meant

by the banality of evil you'll you look

at eichmann in the

in the bulletproof box and you think

that's the guy

i thought he'd be really monstrous

looking and he looks like a paper

pushing bureaucrat

and not that that derek shoving looks

like a paper pushing bureaucrat but he

didn't look like

oh i'm just you know have evil in my

heart

well actually when i did the meeting

between the descendants of so i don't

i can't i don't know much about the

nazis from uh research point of view

i actually was in contact with ricardo

eifman eifman's son oh really

and oh wow yeah and so he he was

actually extremely helpful

in getting uh helping me find distances

of nazis

well and this is what i mean this is why

i looked at the transmission

of the impact of an injustice so

he ricardo is the youngest son

felt and this is back to your question

of variety within a group

he became an archaeologist i've been out

of contact with him for 15 years now so

he was a professor of archaeology and he

said to me it's no surprise i would be

in archaeology

he was always digging in the past and if

i had to characterize

his inheritance of this leg legacy he

was

burdened by it he really wanted to

rectify it

he was um troubled by it

had some guilt about it he felt

responsible

to reach out and that's what i mean

so was he a victim of his

father's misdeeds from his perspective

again i would say are you kidding me

i've suffered more than he did

as a descendant having lost everything

but from his viewpoint it was very hard

carrying that legacy

very hard um however there's variety

within the group and this is really

important

his brother did not feel that way

right one of his siblings his brother

sort of supported

justified so and the same thing with

descendants of survivors right i had

some people who said i'm not coming to

this group to meet the other side i'll

never talk to the other side

there's variety within the group that's

why it's very hard to

lump any group

and make these generalizations for those

who are affected

like um the eichmann's son what's his

name again

rudolph oh ricardo um

what what is the vehicle of transmission

of the guilt from the father to the son

yeah that's a good question and i would

say

all of us your included michael have all

gotten something from our parents that

were transmitted through stories

whether the stories were told through

conversation that's

such an important question because

that's a lot of my research and i talk

about that in chapter two and three

that's what i called our attachments our

identities

how is that transmitted well there's so

much biological evidence and i don't

think this is a big surprise

that we are very attached most of us to

our caretaker whether that be our mother

our primary caretaker

and we identify then right very strongly

biologically

and that becomes who we are and that's

how it's transmitted

through the stories we try to make sense

of it where did his guilt come from a

word of my

sense of wow this was so unfair what was

done to my parents well then maybe there

were the personality characteristics i

was

sensitive to that i was curious i was

inquisitive

sounds to me like ricardo was too he

became an academician

he was curious he brought that kind of

digging in the past

kind of mind to it um

but that's where the personality

variables i guess come into it but

that's why it's unreasonable to think

that rationality

will by itself solve any of these

polarizing topics

that's like asking someone like an irish

and a catholic

uh who've been at war for 500 years in

the troubles oh just forget about that

just come to the table and let's talk

rational right

their very identities for 500 years or

wrapped up in this

and it's like asking someone to let go

of who they are

it's just not possible very unlikely i

should say

very unlikely same thing with that same

thing with

israeli arab conflict and

the attempt at a two-state solution

seems like a no-brainer to those of us

on the outside

just do it

correct but that's why rationality can

be a strong bond between people but it's

not going to work it's apt to fail when

there are these strong feelings

tied in with our identities especially

if there's been a traumatic injustice

in the legacy and so then you have to

have

through this scientific method this

ability

to look at the polarizing side to look

at the evidence

which and this may be surprising

there's no expert here each person does

it themselves

and that kind of gets you to understand

the inner workings of how you're

understanding

the conflicting data i think i think you

hinted

in your book i think on possible

epigenetic

changes uh due to trauma victimization

ptsd and so on that can be transmitted

across generations i think this is still

pretty controversial and fairly new

research but

um is there are you confident that this

may pan out as something that's

also a vehicle of transmission it could

be i'm not

i mean i do write about it and i'm not

an uh

an expert on epigenetic research

but it seems to me if you just

understand that

as the evolution of cultural learning

it just makes sense to me right and

maybe that's not sufficient way to

understand it

that things are transmitted to us

through learning

and that's all i need to understand

about epigenetics

that my parents experiences your

appearance experiences

at some level were transmitted to us

and has some impact on our identity that

are not

it's not necessarily transmitted through

genetic information

but through cultural information that's

the real point for me about epigenetics

and

why wouldn't that be i mean culture is

so important to human

evolution we have changed so much i mean

sometimes i'm amazed it's what's

happening with the pandemic and how much

behaviors are changing how we are

adapting

right it's an it's it's an instant of

learning and our cultural

interactions are changing rapidly in

three months

some people faster than others so

that by the way

i was thinking about this is why i'm

actually really hopeful

not optimistic i see that as two

completely different things

because i think as long as we're alive

we can learn

humans and also unlearn so that makes me

hopeful that these polarizing topics

that have brought much

conflict today now

animosity misunderstandings

that through learning we can

evolve yeah well you mentioned the

pretty dramatic differences in support

for black lives matter between

republicans and

and democrats or liberals and

conservatives

why is that do you think and what can we

do about that

right and so that speaks exactly to many

of these polarizing topics that i'm

talking about

i can tell you what we cannot do about

it

i think imposing a preemptive

what should be done for example

um xyz is going to breed resentment

like if we say we must have um

reparation programs well some people

will disagree with that

so if you want to have a conversation

move

forward you first have to begin from the

point of view that there are two

sides and that you have to have a

fair-minded way

because conflict between the two sides

that's reality

that's going to go on forever so what is

a fear mechanisms for handling that

the only thing that i know is being able

to look at both viewpoints

scientifically and considering both

without imposing something that's why i

give the example with implicit bias

if you begin a mandatory diversity

training saying

you must get rid of your bias you're

already beginning it with the

preemptive pejorative telling someone

what they must do

people who have a different view and

don't want to be controlled

many people are like that who want to

feel like they have a right

are going to resent that so even though

it may be a great

good intentions it's going to backfire

also if they're not really racist then

you tell them well but

unconsciously you are and you don't even

know it right so get in there and do the

training they're going to resent it even

more

exactly right and then that's actually

what we used to call in psychology a

double bind right

if you're telling people what they

really are and they don't even know it

and then using that as evidence you see

and haven't even admitted it then

they're caught and you're not going to

be able to have a meaningful

conversation under those conditions

you're not going to be able to move

forward but i would say

if you're using the scientific thinking

looking at the both viewpoints

looking at the conflicting evidence it

is more probable

that you will have a dynamic

conversation

where you're respecting each other's

viewpoints not trying to prove that

you're right or wrong

and by the way that's really important

they're not

in our society is so much a society of

debate with the legal system trying to

win my case this method is not about

winning

your case it's not about showing your

right

it's not about showing the other

person's wrong it's about

wanting to move forward in a

conversation

and i apply that to myself so i might

also add i may be wrong

completely wrong about this and i would

say try it

if it doesn't work then stop it but

don't take my word for it

yeah i have a lot of conservative

friends and you know we talk about this

when we're out on our bike rides and uh

yeah

you know they say i don't support the

black lives matter movement well do you

think black lives matter of course i

think black lives matter

black lives matter too that made me

think maybe that should have been the

slogan

black lives matter too because that's

unobjectionable of course they do

um but unfortunately like all social

movements the black lives matter

movement has taken on a whole bunch of

other

uh baggage along with it that you know

people don't support and therefore they

they jettison the whole thing and then

that makes it even more polarized

yes because it means two things uh

someone actually mentioned that in class

last night that it's both the movement

and it's a

and it's a statement and that's true and

that's really important

yeah because uh you know i will say yes

of course black lives matter

then you support reparations well maybe

not oh so you don't think black lives

matter no

these are two different things um

yeah so and again i was thinking of the

research of seth

stevens davidovitz who was a google

data analyst he wrote a book about this

about

line and detecting line or whatever i

forget the title of it but it was

using google search algorithms to see

what people look up

now this doesn't target on the in the

data sets who said it but but

geographically you can see

where for example people looked up you

know n word jokes

right after obama was elected and there

was a little spike in this

uh and it was a spike in sort of these

more conservative areas

so anyway his whole book is pretty

interesting because a

it shows that there's still plenty of

racists around looking up

jokes like that or other things that are

characteristic

although he did show that by the way

people that are likely to look

up inward jokes online are also more

likely to look up

frank sinatra social security

things that are indicating that well

these are older people

in these kind of conservative areas of

the country so

you know a clearly racism hasn't

disappeared it's still around but he did

show that

you know it is definitely on the decline

fewer people are looking up those kind

of jokes then

maybe 10 years ago so it doesn't go back

very far but if you look at the research

from pew and gallop going back to the

1950s you know

how likely would you be to move out if a

black family moved in next door or

would you be upset if a member of your

family married a

a person from another race you know

those numbers are all moving in the

right direction

you know almost to the point where they

don't even ask anymore like asking

uh is interracial marriage moral or

immoral they don't even ask that anymore

and you know so i like to say

conservatives

today are more socially liberal than

liberals were in the 1950s

we've made a lot of progress but the

problem is it's never going to go to

zero

right there's always going to be some

racist [ __ ] around

and if you have a population of 340

million people interacting

a billion times a day you're gonna get

and everybody has a video camera now

you're gonna you're gonna have these

incidences that we see pretty much every

day on youtube

of you know some screaming karen as

they're called now

uh at a target refusing to put her mask

on or yelling at a black person

it was just one this morning of a uh

somebody had a

a black family at a hilton um

they were at the pool and somebody said

you know

what are you doing here are you staying

here not an employee just some white

woman

and uh you know the black woman is like

yes we stay here is my key card and

and this woman called the desk and they

called the police and it was just you

know of course it

everybody filmed it so you know it's

like you're looking at this going god

race you know america is the racist

nation on earth

but no the law of large numbers you know

this

the statistics are all in the right

direction but again there's just enough

of these people

and it's made worse by what you just

said about the kind of polarization

you know because uh people are telling

them

you're a racist no i'm not and then that

kind of drives them further apart and

then they get mad

i'm not going to wear my mask or you

know white lives matter and

they start shouting these things in

defiance and that makes it look even

worse

agreed so if you were in a room with the

the head of the i would say

one of the things that's been pretty

that i have a lot of confidence in in

terms of what you mentioned before where

there's

you know con there's a lot of research

from different

uh fields that points out

that across globally

right all of us have a cross-race what's

called cross-race effect

meaning we're much more able for example

a white person to identify a white face

a black person a black face a

asian and asian face we don't call this

racism

we don't call this bias it has some

practical problems like in a police

lineup

if you're white trying to for black

trying to look at a white person

in a lineup you're likely to get the

face wrong okay so

there's some practical issues but we

don't call the cross-race effect

a bias or racism we say people have a

preference

easier to recognize their own kind

and we accept that as a biological

limitation

in the same way that i have a constraint

i can't bend my arm

this way we don't say oh you're not

flexible we recognize or the same way i

can only remember eight digits these are

constraints that we have

as human beings biological constraints

that's what i talk a lot about in the

book

that's what i meant about attachment so

i'm always really cautious when i use

the word racist of course i'm not a fan

of any kind of violence at all

and i say that from someone who suffered

violence having no family his family

died so i don't say that lightly

i'm really not in favor of any violence

but i use the word racist

carefully because we do have these

biological constraints and preferences

and i don't see that as a racist thing

so yeah so what do we call it i mean

maybe xenophobia is too strong

just tribal instincts to divide

people between self and other our group

in group out group something like that

and probably a preference yeah because

it's familiar

and that's not a racist thing can we

that's that's a constraint and i think

we need to

accept that without a judgment

about it and again i say that with some

confidence there's been at least 600

studies with this cross-race effect and

they're not

conflicting the only exceptions have

been with adoption studies if you're

white or black

adopted by the opposite then you don't

have it as strong

can you learn to distinguish other races

yeah not easily so

uh are these preferences bad

should we be aiming to eliminate them i

don't know well

i don't have the answer one way to

address that is if there's policy

implications so like for example if you

think

uh you know mexicans or somebody from

an arab country is going to immigrate to

america

uh they're not going to carry the same

values we carry therefore

and also maybe they're rapists and

disease

like contagion carriers and and so forth

you know the tropes

um therefore we should keep them out or

we should restrict immigration so

those kinds of categorizations which may

start off as just

cognitive limitations or cognitive

boundaries that we have about judging

other people

in the modern world of nation states

with borders

and on those borders or walls and on

those walls or men with guns

then uh you know then then it does

matter

and i guess yeah yeah of course yeah

yeah i mean

but i was talking more in in the

viewpoint if you're in a conversation

and you want to create a sense of people

feeling safe in a conversation

to talk about their preferences without

feeling judged they're going to be

racist

and they say i have difficulty

actually literally distinguishing people

from another race

so do they have the space in a

conversation to say that i agree with

you with policy

but again my expertise is not policy uh

i didn't mean to um

but but i but i like to talk about it

because it matters

and it's a hot it's a hot button issue

and

you know you end your book talking about

uh the nation state

and what that means and the five

different theories about that and

and then and then the concept of

nationalism well that's another one of

these

hot button issues today the sense that

you know america as a nation or england

as a nation or germany or france or

whatever

as if it's a set of characteristics by

which you can define the

people and you show how difficult that

is

because there's so much variation within

each nation and yet we still seem to

hold it as a cognitive category fairly

strongly

yeah definitely and i mean let's go

through those uh

i really enjoyed that part of the you

know there's five different theories

about what a nation is

primordialism theory claims that nations

and nationalism

are natural phenomena so i guess that

would be any large

grouping of people that are you know

feeling in group compared to some out

group um

perennialist theory reports that nations

whether natural or not have existed as

long as humans have lived in society

so that could be like what maybe a

thousand people or ten thousand people

it doesn't have to be a nation of

millions i guess

and then modernist theory claims that

nations of nationalism are you know

basically the product of the 17th 18th

century

you know collectivization of these small

city-states into larger

uh groupings until we ended up with what

was it something like

i think there was like 500 different

european groups

in 1500 now there's you know worldwide

there's 192 countries so there's been

this kind of

coalescence of smaller groups in the

larger groups

i guess that would be the modernist

theory then you have

ethnosymbolism theory nation formation

must be understood by considering

the importance of heritage myths

memories values symbols

so that's that's a little harder to

define i guess

in terms of how you quantify that

postmodernist theory

about nations argues that nations and

nationalism are narrative

and conversational constructions ways of

thinking about talking about and acting

in the world

um so all the i guess which one of those

you think you're defining a nation as

even

though most people haven't even thought

about it in those terms

kind of sets the stage for what kind of

nationalism

you embrace if you embrace nationalism

at all

yeah um and there's uh there's

there's a difference so i think we can

see that actually with democrats and

republicans

um that difference in how they embrace

nationalism

um yeah again conservatives

in our um big flag waivers family

um flag you know faith the three f's

you know when you look at those

personality big five

studies that you know conservatives tend

to be

you know more conscientious more

closed-minded

lower on open-mindedness to experience

they tend to be a little more neurotic

in the sense of being more anxious about

new

environments loud noises strange people

things like this and and so one theory

is that

and and we know that at least 50 percent

of the of the variation in

in the big five personality dimensions

is heritable

um therefore there's this idea that

i'll just kind of refer just a second

here

that now as we were evolving in these

small bands of hunter-gatherers

there's a sense that outsiders are

dangerous

so you have to have some kind of

protections against

outsiders coming in to contaminate us or

kill us or whatever that that's normal

and that there's going to be variations

within the group some are more open to

outsiders coming in and

and that kind of diversity is good

genetic diversity diversity of new ideas

coming into a group

but not so much that that the group

loses its identity

so it seems like there's always this

balance between

um well john stewart mill said this and

also i think it was bertrand russell

that

you know in the sort of the history of

politics you have this there's always

kind of a dualopoly

no matter how you what you call the

different parties they all kind of

separate into these kind of left and

right

and and and you need both because if if

it's just up to one they're going to go

too far in one direction so that kind of

constant pushback and the tension seems

to be

on this question you know to what

extension would be open to

bringing in outsiders to our group we

need some

some some diversity is good but not too

much diversity

and that conservatives tend to be on the

side of let's dial it down and not have

too much diversity

in liberals the other direction and you

you strike some balance there

say the immigration policies of japan

versus the united states versus some

european countries that are

that are more liberal on that i don't

know if you want to

talk about that because you you talk

about this a lot in the book about the

neuroscience and psychology behind

how we feel about outsiders and and

other people and groupings like that

well i think the uh the statement i

would make is

whether you are for or against

immigration for example or diversity the

fact is and this is a universal truth i

don't think any listener can disagree

with this

whether we like it or not diversity is

the feature of life

whether we're talking look out the

window plants

flowers and human beings so

it's not whether we embrace it

or impose it on others it exists in

in reality it's a fact

in the book i talk about the origins of

how we're constantly trying to make

sense of the diversity

and that's been part of our historical

and scientific efforts so

it's here and there'll always be

conflicting views

which is what you're just describing on

on

how to manage it um

but i think you hit it on the head i

would say that

the conflict between the views is gonna

is

is not necessarily a bad thing there'll

always be conflicting views

my work has been how do you

um

how do you manage or deal or cope with

the conflicting views

that's what i've tried to put forth

really and that's

very important i'm not arguing for or

against

it i'm accepting reality as it is and

saying what are we going to do now that

it's here

how can we understand it okay let's use

a

real world example let's say you you're

the

the uh the guide for a

three-day all-day conversation between

some israeli leaders and some

palestinian leaders

all right how can we get to a two-state

solution go

right so again you're bringing it to the

policy level i'm not sure i have the

expertise

um to to be that person but

if i was bringing together palestinians

and israelis in an informal conversation

and then maybe they would apply it to

you know the conflict in israel um i

would begin what we've talked

about the whole time which is each

hearing

the other side there's three

aspects to teaching scientific thinking

in these conversations

and the facilitator or me whoever is not

the expert

so it's a great word you use more of a

guide and so what

the people in these polarizing topics

would be doing is

first learning about themselves the

inner workings of their own mind

how are they evaluating

whatever the issues are the land their

country

nationalism the other each person does

that differently

what is the how are they doing in their

own individual minds i don't know

that's for them to discover and the

second level of learning in this

conversation is how whatever view they

might be having how is that

impacting the other side

because what we say and do in

conversation has an impact on the other

side

right so if i say to you you're a racist

you're biased you have implicit bias i'm

probably shutting down the conversation

and it's not going to help us move

forward so

they're looking at the inner workings

they're looking at what impact that has

and then they're

learning to look at conflicting evidence

and make sense of

it and then they're coming to the

conclusion of what needs to be done

but there is no expert telling them what

they should do

right when i was writing the moral arc

it looked like

nationalism was kind of on the way out

and i

projected in the final chapter that

maybe in a century or two

there'll be no more nation states and

we'll be back to city-states just

you know the largely poorest borders

between cities and

people can go anywhere they want in the

internet and travel and on and on

well things have changed rather

dramatically in the last four years and

there's you know many books now

defending nationalism

and um you know

yes right the european union is

right yeah no that's true and i think

through history we've seen that that's

you know sort of the rise and the fall

i've looked at it also in the book

a lot about what the impact is how it's

how our

relationships between how human being

relationships have changed

over time um with the development of the

nation-state which is also really

interesting to me

literally because that has an impact on

how we

interact with each other how these

conversations take place

which of those theories of of the nation

do you embrace or do you think is that

the most explanatory power for what

people do and think

i don't know i'd have to review it again

yeah i was just thinking about that

i really have to read because i haven't

thought about that chapter and i didn't

know we discussed it so it's funny

i think i was presenting it as

alternative is what

and i was trying to look at the factors

because of the increase in nationalism

but that is why i actually think

scientific thinking is so important

which was my point

there definitely has been a trajectory

up of nationalism

and so i'm not the first to say this

einstein

feinman madam curate i begin my whole

book on that when they were talking

about the importance of scientific

thinking they were doing it

at a time that they were concerned about

the rise of authoritarianism fascism

and they were saying that the only

counter

the only way to kind of counter the

effects of

the rise of nationalism and fascism was

to have people

develop autonomous thinking that was

really my

i like that point are we are we in a

similar situation

now to that and how can that be

countered and i would agree

with that statement michael i think very

strongly

i completely agree with them that it's

not the content of the science it's the

way

to think so that you can um

think for yourself autonomously which

has become more and more important

especially now i mean they didn't even

have to well feynman talked a lot about

propaganda those were the words now now

we talk about it as

post-truth and i know people say oh no

there's no said qing is not post truth

because if i'm talking about it but i'm

not

being philosophically clever here there

is

um it is more difficult for the public

to grab

on to a a agreed upon

truth and feynman and

einstein saw that happen different time

periods

but for similar reasons and so that to

me

is what's important with the rise of

nationalism we know that

income inequality is very correlated

and the studies looks i may be wrong and

someone could find some contradictory

studies but it seems to be uh related to

the rise in nationalism as well

yeah the higher the state of income

inequality the more likely

the higher you know nationalism so

i have i mean i think what i'm proposing

is really important

i i mean that sincerely because i think

it really does

offer the chance for people to

think through these issues in a more

thoughtful way and the fact that

einstein and madame curie and feynman

said it before me

makes me more confident because they're

wiser

not politicos or philosophers exactly

tell us again in your own words uh what

what is your what are you proposing

well on a very concrete level i'm

proposing that

learning to think scientifically be

sandwiched in

in all classes that you know i think it

was plato

right if you had to go to the academy

you weren't allowed in

if you didn't know geometry i would say

you should not be allowed out of the

gates

especially a place like harvard unless

you've learned how to think

scientifically

it seems to me it's a very important

skill

for citizens to have and that just

giving people

information and facts is not sufficient

it's not a top down it's giving them the

critical skill

what we were talking about to weigh

conflicting evidence

and then understand the inner workings

of their own mind why aren't they

cherry-picking

why do they want this study to be the

right one we all do that

i mean i just i give you a funny example

of it but it was actually profound

experience i had just a few days ago

i've been very focused

uh again i'm not proud of this but it

just shows you how you can zero in on

something right

and not see the whole picture and i was

very

focused on how many people should we

have in a discussion group what's the

best for the discussion to occur

especially on zoom i've been doing this

for many years three four

five and for years i've been asking this

question

looking at the research and i finally

asked the dean of the summer school at

harvard what do you think because i was

in a faculty meeting there were five of

us

and i thought ah so i've had it wrong it

shouldn't be that to me

well actually i don't think it has

anything to do with the number of people

it's the people the participants

and i was like well that's obvious i

literally

had this zero view on it and i was very

attached

and that's just an example with no

emotion attached to it

but so teaching students how to think

scientifically enlarges the vision

conflicting evidence they're they're

less

likely to become polarized that's what

i'm suggesting i think

i think that's brilliant absolutely of

course of course i love that that's what

i think too

so i know you're right uh

the biggest obstacles to that now are

you know that sort of polarized media

and social media and in which there's

very little subtlety

and and like acknowledgement that's such

an important word

thank you michael i've been fixated on

this word

subtlety and nuance all and that's what

you mentioned before

correct i'm sorry to interrupt you but i

got excited

nuance and that's what critical thinking

does it teaches

nuanced thinking so not all whites

all blacks all conservatives there's a

nuanced discussion

to understanding the data and i i think

that is very important

well we need an economic model for media

companies

to to embrace that because it seems like

the simpler

and more polarized and black and white

it is the more hits they get

or commercials that they sell and

whatever

yeah i don't know i know i wish i

knew how to but but back to you know at

the end of your book

you make this distinction between ethnic

nationalism and civic

nationalism so it's the ethnic

nationalism that has me worried

because it's kind of a throwback to the

old blood and soil

to finding people by almost their genes

or

you know what what piece of geography

they happen to be sitting on

whereas civic nationalism is more of a

collection of ideas

it's the ideas that that we should care

about i mean certain

like civil rights civil liberties gay

rights gay marriage

women's rights and so forth animal

rights and

and whatnot um those aren't

to me those aren't western values even

though you can track it

historically through western uh

traditions of thinking

that their human values you know sort of

that the idea of

universal human rights in fact that that

when that was adopted in 1948 you know

it still holds pretty

pretty well and i i you know sometimes

people

politically correct people are accusing

you know westerners of genocide and

whatnot and

and then affiliating that set of ideas

no that

you have to separate those you know the

sort of ethnic naturalism of people

doing things in the name of their

country that are

bad for other people in other nations

that's different from

we want to spread the idea of say

democracy or civil rights in other

countries we we want to hold china

accountable for their civil rights

violations

however we do that through economic

sanctions or something

that's a different kind of nationalism

than that ethnic nationalism so

i like that you make that distinction

the end of your book

i make the distinction but i would say

again they'll always be people who

espace

ethnic nationalism uh the rule of the

law or blood and soil as you put it

and are less likely to want immigration

and so forth and i'm saying there'll

always be alternative views of what the

correct nationalism is i wouldn't say

that ethnic uh nationalism is better

i might personally believe that but i

have to be

open to the view as long and this is

important we do not get to this but i

think i do want to say this because i

think it's very important

i'm open to the view of a blood and soil

view of nationalism

with the one statement and that

i don't mean to suggest that all views

pluralism

i mean sorry moral equivalency

i'm not suggesting that all views have

equal

value i am saying if if there's any view

and whether that be the blood and soil

view or whatever view that says

we need to destroy the diversity that's

where the buck stops so to speak

so i would say i'm a proponent of

pluralism

hypothetical views of nationalism

as long as no one is calling for the

destruction of any of it i don't know if

that's clear

but that's important um so i'm not

espousing

civic uh nationalism i mean i may

personally again agree with that but

there'll always be people who disagree

with me and i want to talk to those

people

maybe i'm missing something maybe i

haven't thought it through

maybe i don't know what it's like to

have come for example to the united

states on the mayflower right and have

10 generations and see my country

change so much maybe i would not like

the changes

at a feeling level i would like to be

entitled to those feelings that's not my

case i come from

a family of immigrants and so i'm

obviously very happy that the country

allowed it my parents

but you're also you're also jewish so do

you feel like

that uh you know the existence of israel

as a nation-state

is really important because we have this

kind of

deep sense of a place to call our own

each group or something like that and

because of the

diaspora for thousands of years this

this was

fully justified on that level something

like that

well yeah michael those are big topics

so first of all when you say you're

jewish or israel or zionism

um just personally i

that to me is like lumping in a category

that's like saying you're white so what

do you think about this

right i'm not i'm not offended at all

it's just that i probably

don't fit the category right diversity

and that would be a whole that would be

a whole conversation

uh not that i'm against the category but

i probably am an outlier

in my opinions on that and also i might

say

that my views on that have evolved a lot

interesting i've changed i've changed my

mind a lot

which is like you know yeah i actually

said someone before the interview oh my

goodness how about if he reads something

i wrote in high school and he asks me

that

which you didn't find so that's good how

do i explain it

and uh i asked my teaching fellow and he

said just you know

you're an example of what you're talking

about i teach my thinking is evolving

well

that's good so i think i don't know what

the question is exactly on that but

well i was just in my own head thinking

out loud

about the nation state i'm not a big fan

to me

in the long run i'd like to see borders

dissolve i love the idea of the eu

uh and that you can just travel from one

country to another without passports and

and all that

and why can't the whole world be like

that and

i'm always citing my fa one of my

favorite movies uh a few good men were

jack nicholson schools uh tom cruise on

on the the nature of the

of the real world that you know we live

in a world with walls and on those walls

are men with guns

and you want me on that wall he's kind

of defending that kind of

conservative defense of the military and

why you need a strong military because

that's the world we live in

okay well he's right that is the world

we live in but wouldn't it be nice if we

didn't have

to have walls with men's with men with

guns on them

and and so i like the idea of dissolving

nations

uh borders uh and have a more diverse

uh uh you know world community but you

know i think we're a long ways from that

if

ever centuries maybe um i don't know

but but uh anyway that that's why i was

thinking out loud although i've always

been a supporter of israel

i'm not jewish but uh and the fact that

i even have to say that is idiotic

uh but but i but but the jewish people i

know

you know it's like i totally get this

why everybody wants

this is my country everybody feels that

way

and that scene the palestinians feel

that way that's right

yeah right yeah exactly yeah

so um i mean i think it's very important

uh and there's actually it's funny back

to what i'm saying about polarized views

i haven't looked at the book but i heard

there's a history book

that's taught israelis and palestinians

that discuss

the creation of israel and on one line

they have the israeli version and the

other they have the palestinian

so what's called the independence is

called the i forget in the palestinian

view

the tragedy or something so i would say

in discussing this topic which is a

very polarizing topic back to what i've

been saying we need to see both those

views

there's not a one view and there are two

people with

two groups of people with variety of

opinions and both

but um it's interesting that they

actually have a history book like that

first of its kind because it was always

interesting one in one view only

and so obviously if you teach it in only

one view your view on nationalism is

going to be different

that's what i meant by the evolution of

my view i probably started very

one-sided

because no one presented the other view

to me and so now i can

look at both views much better

and i think a lot of these conflicts uh

you know

back to the protestants and the

catholics these are

historical conflicts that go back

hundreds of years in the case of

palestinians and israelis

i actually think it's one of the first

injustices in the bible

that's ever been discussed which was um

you know when the

the sun was the

arab sun was um excluded from his

inheritance

and uh there's some collective i

wouldn't be surprised

trauma that's been passed down about

that injustice

but injustice is usually a two-sided

issue

and and questions of nationalism are

like that i think we would need in

america at the very least a a

three-panel

uh history because the native americans

also

and you know back to reparations the

moment you open that door up well the

native americans have at least as strong

a case

uh as african americans and um

you know so and white americans have a

case

too again i'm not saying i agree with it

but there's complexity what was the word

view it's not nuanced

there's a subtlety you know and and

these topics are usually not discussed

with that subtlety

you know gates work is really good about

the slavery trade and i

recommend that people look at how he

understands it because he gets into the

complexity and he says we can't teach it

we can't teach it because people are not

ready for the complexity when i did the

descendant of the slave and slave owner

meetings i had the same

i mean survivor not that the same issue

i brought the complexity

i brought descendants of collaborators i

mean it's

it's not a black and white situation

there is a gray zone descendant-wise

again i really want to emphasize i'm not

talking about people who committed

crimes

so that complexity has to be brought and

definitely with the palestinian and the

israeli yeah

and that's where i'm back to my point

that's why scientific thinking

is so important because it trains the

mind to consider

those variables that are missing unlike

me focused on what's the number of

people i need no there are other

variables we have to consider

not to mention even when we have all the

variables there's conflicting evidence

and that helps the discussion a lot

because then you can talk about these

things

really getting the fuller

the fuller picture which a couple other

things i want to ask you about you talk

about energy

generate you have a chapter on

intergenerational justice that we

we've touched on in the ten commandments

god pretends to punish

quote the inequity of the fathers on

children to the third and fourth

generation

of course to which we go what and then

you say the bible also says that it's

wrong to punish anyone for the sins of

another so

how are those squared

right it's very interesting i like to

look to the bible

as a way of how we've understood our

history and i think that's the

contradiction

so i think at a human psychological

level

i want to hold all germans responsible

for the fact that i grew up without a

family

and that was my feeling growing up it

was not easy

not having zero relatives

someone's got to be responsible for this

so that's a that's a normal thing

i don't care whether you were alive or

not okay you should feel guilty you

should feel responsible and furthermore

you should feel like you want to make it

up to me

that's a normal feeling most of us

tonight through a lot of the evidence

have a psychological need

to right a wrong psychologically again i

don't mean legally

and if that can't be done we're

frustrated

but the reality is and i think that

the bible gets at that

is it really right that i'm holding

someone responsible

wasn't alive am i in fact making that

person feel

guilty and causing some harm that i'm

not even aware of

i mean i have a very very close dear

friend who's a child of a

waff and ss officer we've been friends

for 30 years

she grew up with such guilt and shame

it took her a long time i i personally

would not want to be contributing to

that doesn't seem right to me

she was not born when this happened

that's taken a long development and we

can

obviously see that model with

descendants of slave enslavement of

course many descendants of slaves are

going to feel

are you kidding me i don't care that

it's nine generations ago

whites are still benefiting from it but

there are many whites who don't have

that view like my

friend they feel that they that they're

being held accountable for something

they had no

taken in fact they feel they're victims

yeah

and because they have not had the

benefits and they're resentful of things

like affirmative action yes

well they feel donald trump in 2016 that

kind of vast

midwest poor whites that that never

recovered from the 0809 meltdown

and you know the the you know the opioid

crisis hit them hardest and they feel

like they're victims correct and so i

would say that

if we want to move forward those are

viewpoints that

deserve our listening to because

yeah you had a couple other points i i

found interesting and

discussion of what i think is called

just world theory

just i'm quoting you here just observing

an innocent person being victimized is

sufficient to make the victim seem

unworthy

and then you're quoting citing learner

here i'm not sure who that is

observe that when one of two men was

chosen at random

to receive a reward for a task this

caused him to be more favorably

evaluated by observers

even though the observers had been

informed that the recipient of the

reward was chosen at random

uh you know this is i i think

conservatives more than liberals embrace

this just world theory if somebody's

poor it's because they're lazy or

they don't work hard or uh you know

whatever

in a way it's kind of a you mentioned

cognitive dissonance

it it's cognitively dissonant to

see that there's people less well-off

than me

poorer than me and so on and the just

world theory is a way of reducing the

the dissonance by saying well that's the

way it is that's the way it's supposed

to be uh

you know i worked hard correct blame the

victim

but i want to say that go ahead

right you blame the victim so they

haven't succeeded

you know you see that with rape victims

so she was raped because she was

probably

provocative or did something but back to

the conservative view

i would look at the evidence you know i

personally have heard for example people

say well you know i've got higher

unemployment in these last few months

than my job because there's this

additional 600

they've been getting and i'm not sure i

want to go back to my job

so i mean this is an end of one or two

but i would not dismiss

the conservative view that

people have gotten you know

more than i was given or something i'm

saying there's

that view needs to be considered as well

even though i may not agree with it

and that's what's important in these

discussions i don't know if i explained

that if i had yeah

yeah yeah that that makes sense um i

mean

i remember there were stories out of the

holocaust again

that i was when i was reading

researching my book on that that um

you know that a lot of germans would you

know the germans deprived

jewish communities of a lot of the

basics of life

and then looked at them and said look

they live they live like animals look

how dirty they are well you don't

you took away their homes uh

you know it's a way of rationalizing or

justifying in their own minds the

germans i guess

uh for why it was okay that they did

this

yeah and again even in that and i think

i go over this in my other book justice

matters

obviously i don't agree as i said in the

beginning to the destruction of

diversity

whether it's jews blacks whoever

but if you look at hitler's mind comp

it's very logical

his explanation that jews are taking

over the world

and are and germans are suffering

uh because of what the jews have done

i'm saying there's an argument there

i mean that's actually what's kind of

scary about it but you can't you you

you can look at these arguments and try

to understand them as long as they're

not

you know trying to destroy the other

side in that case but

um but the other what you were

describing about you know saying yeah

you know creating a situation and then

saying oh yeah you see they're acting

that way

i mean that's those are true right right

yeah i mean so like one conservative

argument against black lives matter is

well most of the crime against blacks is

by other blacks or most homicides

in the black community are by black

black on black crime say

well but then why is that even assuming

that's true why

why is that um you know we have to look

at the deeper issues of

you know poverty and and fatherless

homes or you know whatever half a dozen

different variables

um that was the other thing at the

beginning of your book that um

i thought was pretty interesting about

you know sort of the tracking the

history of psychology from so freud

to behaviorism to the cognitive

revolution

and that's that's where i came online in

psychology was

in that transition from behaviorism to

cognitive psych

i actually worked for two years and i'm

in a canarian lab

running experiments with rats in in in

boxes pressing bars

so i kind of missed the cognitive

revolution when it happened in the in

the late 70s and 80s

which is super interesting but now um

you talk about

um embodied cognition ecological

psychology acts of meaning

and and action t i o ena

situated cognition embedded cognition

extended

cognition these are examples of the

terms that post

cognitive researchers introduced so just

give us a

little five minute uh you know kind of

overview of what

psychology has gone through and well i

see the last 20 years

in five minutes or less please

that's not fair i haven't read that let

me just put

but no but i'll say one thing about that

but the important point i'll summarize

it

the important point i think is where we

started and where we've ended up in

psychology

and so where we started was seeing the

human being as a black box

pretty much or there were some things

that we you know

we we don't really understand and then

we progressed a little to the input and

the output but we

but the arrow what happens between the

input and the output that's the way i

think about it

you know the skinny schenerian model was

do this and you get this and then comes

along oh so something happens here

right motivation

um and then there was the computer model

oh

you know humans are just like machines

right we had all these great

cognitive psychologists talk about the

metaphor

the the mind as a brain but then there

were biologists

varela and other very interesting

biologists who said you know what human

beings are autonomous and

you cannot separate and this is the

really important point to all that i've

been talking about

this is why i've said in the interview

several times you cannot expect people

to solve these problems sometimes i hear

colleagues say oh we just tell them

about

their cognitive biases we just tell them

to be rational

no because human beings are embodied and

our cognitions are related to our

our emotions without our emotions we

couldn't make decisions

we are they they the rational would not

allow us in some circumstances yes but

not

in all that's the real point of that

that's what i was really trying to get

at

and um is so if you're trying to deal

with these

polarizing topics where there's a

traumatic event history and memories and

identities

and i try to explain that whole process

in the book we're very much

our evaluations of everything in life

are very much connected to our feelings

about it you have this passage and so

yeah this passage i highlighted dreyfus

and other

post-cognitive researchers argue that a

science the mind

will never be able to understand the

human mind and behavior

in the same way scientists understand

objects in

for example physics or chemistry that is

by considering people as

things whose mind and behavior can be

predicted via objective

context-free scientific laws this is

what i mean at the

at the beginning of our conversation

that you've in a way you're kind of

undermining this

this long scientific tradition of you

know we're going to find the laws of

human action and boom we

we got it yes and that's a very i've

thought a lot about this

in 20 years and i think that's because

it's first of all people studying people

right it's not people studying objects

and so once people studying people

robert rosenthal one of my mentors at

harvard brilliant talked about all the

artifacts

what happens right i don't know what

you're going to do when i say something

i mean i might be able to predict it but

in this conversation you may ask me

something i've never been asked before i

may say something you've never heard

before there's an unpredictable element

to human interaction and when a person

a scientist is a person researchers

studying another unpredictable things

happen and so we can't have an input

output model we have to have an

indeterministic

model and we have to understand how

people evaluate

i call it developing a potential so

rather than sometimes of course we can

predict if i hit you over the head with

a hammer i know you're going to scream

but if i'm having a dynamic conversation

what i think scientific thinking helps

in these indeterministic

situations is to create a potential

so that we can move forward and learn

together it's a dynamic system and that

to me has been really helpful

really helpful personally and

professionally

again i may be completely wrong

well it's the best it's the best

argument that i make for

for cryonics is so you can be frozen and

come back 500 years to see

how that particular argument turned out

yeah oh consciousness we figured that

out two centuries ago that's a that's a

no-brainer oh really

uh speaking of which i i also

highlighted this passage in your

discussion of a.i

post cognitive researchers argue that

the human meant that human mental life

depends mainly on

unconscious subjective judgments rather

than conscious

objective information manipulation and

that these unconscious phenomena can

never be captured in formal

computational rules as suggested by the

traditional cognitive approach

post-cognitive researchers assert that

to get a computer to have a human-like

mind

requires computers to have a human-like

being in the world

with little hyphens in there human-like

being in the world

and to have bodies more or less like

humans and social acculturation

in other words society more or less like

humans so so many ai researchers and

also i encountered this with the

this is from my previous book on heavens

on earth about the attempts to achieve

immortality

these people have this the idea of mind

uploading we're going to upload your

mind

get your connectome copy every single

synaptic connection in your brain

upload it to the cloud and you'll go

there well first of all you wouldn't go

anywhere because it's just a copy

so you're still here wherever the copy

machine is but

nevertheless that that wouldn't capture

anything i just you just described

right that that you have to it's not

just a mind it's a mind in a body and

not just a mind and a body it's a

it's a body in a physical environment

that moves around and

and most of the processing of all that

information happens subconsciously

there's there's there's no algorithms

you can you know mimic in a computer

that would

capture that and then multiply that by a

gazillion

you know for all the interactions with

people we have with environments

plants animals and so on everything

that's exactly right that's exactly

right

so there are situations obviously that

our systems are deterministic

but there is this whole other realm of

indeterminate what i call indeterminism

where you can't predict

so do you think this is and that is the

human being and that is interactions

and um i'm trying to think of analogy to

chess but it's not good so

yeah yeah maybe go

seems to be the new model well this

could explain both

why um you know human level

a.i you know is is five years away and

always will be as they say

you know it's a much harder problem than

we thought and it's not just a harder

problem

you know algorithmically you know like

computers that finally beat gary

kasparov and chess they just

got the number crunching capability

finally there

we're never going to get there with this

particular approach i i think is the

implications of

of this post cognitive research that

this is the wrong approach to take

because humans

evaluate relations and they put values

and

judge relations and it's hard to predict

that

so if you just have

material give i mean ai could be good

just with deterministic

systems but let's go to our polarized

topics

let's take any polarizing topic um

immigration and let's take that some

people forward some people against it

that we could call a relational

parameter what i call a relational and i

wrote about this in doing psychotherapy

effectively that means

some people value newness

openness positively emotionally it's a

judgment about that relation

other people don't they have a a

negative feeling about it right and so

we

because we value relationships

differently i don't think that can be

programmed i think that and we can

switch those

that's why it's helpful to understand i

mean

take a marital example if you're in a

couple

and you're my husband um

likes new adventures and i don't we have

different values on this well

maybe over time we'll switch and

understand

and change each other's evaluations but

these are values we give

and i think that's why you can't use the

input output

that's why you can't just be a

deterministic system

i don't know if that explained it but

that's how i understand it i think also

helps explain the difficulty in

in explaining consciousness um not the

neural correlates of consciousness but

the actual experience of it

i think everything you've just described

complicates it you know orders of

magnitude more than it already was

yeah and it's what makes each of us kind

of different from the other

which is why it's uh yeah i mean we can

share but

um it's

you can't love but it is but i don't

want to underestimate

we can predict a lot of our preferences

that's why so the advertising is so

successful right

i know if you check out one liberal view

i can predict

that i understand it that's how a lot of

advertising works i can predict

probably what you're going to buy and if

i know what you just bought on amazon

if you bought a tie versus hiking shorts

i can say a lot about you

so we are very predictable and

deterministic in many areas

but we can't ignore that there are these

indeterministic

unpredictable aspects of human behavior

and life the pandemic

these social changes we no one could

predict this

we still don't know how to deal with it

because there's a lot of uncertainty we

don't have models from the past

that my very point is the universe as a

whole

indeterministic well so now uh

you get to free will i mean where does

free will enter into all this

or volition or whatever words you want

to use

i don't know i think you know more about

that i don't know the answer either i

i'm a compatibilist i think we i think

for the very

things everything you've been saying

that we are engaged

in the causal net of the universe

ourselves and can manipulate it

either consciously or unconsciously and

maybe that's

also a causal vector and therefore we're

all determined but at least we can be

aware of the determining factors and

tweak them

a little bit therefore we can hold

people accountable and so forth

so but you know again it's a hard

problem because of the way the words are

defined

uh we may be restricted on our cognition

about it because of language

i don't know um see if there's anything

else i wanted to ask you here before we

wrap up

the mona we've been going almost two

hours oh my god i just looked at the

clock wow

there's so much interesting stuff here i

think

your book science and diversity i mean

this should be read

by everybody thinking about these

particular issues i mean diversity you

have chapters on diversity in groups

diversity and social justice

you know that made me think about this

other thing we're undergoing now this

whole

um what what it means to be a gender um

you know have a sex role or a gender

role and

and now there's all this stuff about um

you know gender dysphoria

and you know i was born a woman but i

feel like a man so should i get the

surgery

you know you're aware that this has

become a controversial subject

that touches on the nature of self i

guess which you also hint at in the book

um you know this self is rather a

elusive concept i feel like a self

and i define myself by certain

characteristics but i can't do that

outside of

what how i'm situated in in my nation

state in my gender

my group my race my everything

you know that's really i have two things

to say the practical it's interesting

you talk about gender and this is an

example

of good intentions and good solutions

can have paradoxical effects so

uh there was a rule at harvard i don't

know the exact details but the

single gender clubs were being penalized

they were trying to discourage all male

or all female and then

just the other day the judge in boston

said that was denied harvard's case

to continue and so um

president baka put out a very

interesting memo

saying well obviously we're going to

abide by what the judge said

and the logic here was that in trying to

solve the discrimination we were

actually perpetuating a discrimination

and so there is a good example you

brought up gender

uh you have a good solution we're going

to ban the one

gender clubs but in doing that you're

actually

creating resentment right so

but to your question of the self i've

thought a lot about that

and i think that's a very interesting

question and i've come to the conclusion

it's just for me personally um that

things don't always appear the way they

are in reality

and that's helpful to know first of all

so i mean i think

all of us can agree understand that the

world does look

flat i always this is obvious right but

it's it's deceiving

and that's a good example um

you know we're not aware of gravity but

obviously it's

what's keeping us stable we're not aware

of moving

so fast but so appearances are not

reality and i think for me

it's been helpful to think of the self

like that

because it looks like i'm independent

feels like it an autonomous feels like

i know where my body begins and ends but

again pragmatically look at the pandemic

you see how

intertwined our lives are could not

function without

you know whole foods has a sign you're

more than essential really

we're interconnected and so far i'd have

no food if there weren't people

willing to go to the supermarket and so

our connection with each other though it

may not be visible though we may have

the means to think we're independent

we're obviously have some

i mean obviously to me we have some

interconnection with each other

um and i know this may sound naive

but and and and that is why

i like your vision of oh no borders kind

of goes with

my vision of that's why

it makes sense to help each other and

understand the other

because we are at some level

interconnected

and if i may add one thing here because

i mean this deeply

and i've written i mean you've written

written this but i've thought a lot

about it you know

my mother was 17 when she was in

auschwitz she lost everyone so she

suffered a lot

saw a lot of suffering and before she

died she did that interview with

spielberg i mean for someone talking

about and they asked her what's the last

message

maybe a few months before she literally

died what's your last message you want

to give people your experience and

auschwitz

and so she said i don't want anyone to

suffer like i did

and i thought wow that's profound i was

really surprised

that she had it in her heart to care

about other people

and that to me speaks to she wasn't just

a self

she probably had some sense of that you

know

and so um that's what i have to say

about yourself

yeah that's quite a powerful story about

your mom wow that's incredible

well i figure if she could do that and

care about the other after all she's

been through

well why wouldn't i and

do the little that i could do and that's

why i think it's worth hearing the other

side even when we don't agree with them

whether they be liberals conservatives

republicans democrats black lives matter

yeah well i want to ask you just one

last thing you know we're recording this

right smack in the middle of 2020 which

could end up being

the biggest year since 1968 or the end

of the vietnam war something

or maybe even worse than that or more

dramatic than that we have covet 19 the

shutdown of the economy so economic

stress is unemployment

black lives matter the metoo movement uh

you know and whatever else gets thrown

in in the next six months

how do you think uh life may change in

the coming

decade or two because of all these these

changes

um wow

you know it's interesting you've asked

that because as i said

usually when we make prediction in

science we have something in the past

to go on so we can predict it so what i

did as a scientist was obviously look at

the pandemic i mean the flu

because that's the closest of 1918. okay

so

what happened when they got out of it um

as

that i could see something interestingly

right they went into a period of

exuberance the roaring 1920s

fitzgerald the party right

exuberant yeah i the only way i know how

to make a prediction is based on the

past but i don't think this pandemic is

necessarily

similar i know the answer may be

i don't know and you don't either nobody

does

i have i cannot say i mean on the

positive side as i mentioned before

i've been amazed at how human behave has

adapted yeah

yeah pretty adaptive yes pretty adaptive

so

is it good is it bad what about the

future of higher education i assume

harvard will be okay

but there's a lot of oh that is yeah

that's it that's

that's huge i mean i think that is a

huge question and that i've thought a

lot about

and um well

i mean i have a lot to say about that i

don't want to take up more of your time

but a lot of that has

to do with our delivery of education

i've been actually teaching my course

at harvard on zoom before the pandemic

so i did and i did it eight nine years

ago

when we started teaching online there

was no video i taught this course only

with audio because zoom didn't have that

capability and i had a hard time

explaining to people

why you could create human interaction

on zoom

in terms of where education is going it

seems to me now that's less of an

argument people do see

value but i don't think it substitutes

for

now let's let's go have uh coffee

together well moana there's your next

book

how to survive in the uh remote

educational environment

thank you so much for this opportunity

michael i'm a real fan of your podcast

and i appreciate that i appreciate it

and i think skeptic

the whole approach is uh very aligned

with uh

my view and uh very important necessary

and helpful

so thank you for thank you for saying

that i appreciate it

thanks for coming on the show and thanks

for writing writing your books and

keep it up okay
